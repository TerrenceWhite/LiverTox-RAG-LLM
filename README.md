# LiverTox-RAG-LLM
A domain-specific RAG system designed to support clinical understanding of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) through natural language question and answering over the LiverTox database. Structured content from approximately 1,700 drug entries in NXML format is extracted, parsed, and segmented before being embedded and stored in a vector database.
