          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tucatinib is tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and is used in combination with other antineoplastic agents in the treatment of refractory, advanced or metastatic HER2 positive breast and colorectal cancer. Serum aminotransferase elevations are common during therapy with tucatinib, but it has not been linked to episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tucatinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tucatinib (too ka&#x02019; ti nib) is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed in some cancers and leads to excessive cell growth and proliferation. HER2 is an oncogenic driver found overexpressed in 15% to 20% of cases of breast cancer and more rarely in other solid tumors such as colorectal cancer. In a large randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial, the addition of tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine was found to induce objective responses in 60% of patients with refractory metastatic or advanced unresectable HER2 positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases. Tucatinib combined with trastuzumab and capecitabine was granted accelerated approval in the United States in 2020 for adults with advanced or metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer after failure of prior anti-HER2-based regimens. Tucatinib unlike monoclonal antibodies penetrates the blood-brain barrier, perhaps accounting for its efficacy in treating brain metastases refractory to monoclonal antibody based anti-HER2 therapies. In 2023, indications for tucatinib were extended to refractory HER2 positive advanced unresectable metastatic colorectal cancers in combination with trastuzumab alone. Tucatinib is available in tablets of 50 and 150 mg under the brand name Tukysa. The recommended dose is 300 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects are common and arise in almost all patients treated with tucatinib combined with trastuzumab and capecitabine and lead to dose modification or interruptions in at least 20% of treated patients and permanent discontinuation in 6%. Common side effects include diarrhea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome), nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, cough, dyspnea, fever, lymphopenia, anemia, and aminotransferase elevations. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include severe diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Of course, some of the toxicity associated with tucatinib therapy may be due to the concurrent use of trastuzumab and capecitabine.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tucatinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine in patients with metastatic and unresectable HER2 positive breast cancer, liver test abnormalities were frequent although usually self-limited and mild. Some degree of ALT elevations arose in 46% of those receiving tucatinib vs 27% treated with trastuzumab and capecitabine alone. Peak ALT levels rose to above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 8% of the tucatinib treated subjects but in less than 1% of controls receiving trastuzumab and capecitabine alone. In a controlled trial enrolling 612 patients with breast cancer, 9 tucatinib treated patients developed ALT elevations and hyperbilirubinemia. Upon further evaluation, however, none of these cases of suspected significant liver injury were considered due to tucatinib, all patients having other possible reasons for liver injury and jaundice. There were no cases of tucatinib-associated liver failure or hepatotoxicity leading to death in any of the prelicensure studies. The product label for tucatinib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests before and every 3 weeks during therapy, and as clinically indicated.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tucatinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from tucatinib is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities suggests direct liver injury. Tucatinib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 2C8 and 3A4, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce these CYP enzyme reactivities. Tucatinib is also an inhibitor CYP 3A4 and P-glycoprotein and can increase the toxicity of drugs that are substrates for these enzymes and transporters.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tucatinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for tucatinib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests before and every 3 weeks during treatment. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times ULN or bilirubin above 3 times ULN should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation of tucatinib therapy and careful monitoring. If serum aminotransferase levels and bilirubin improve to normal or near normal levels, tucatinib can be restarted at a lower dose. In patients with ALT elevations above 20 times ULN or any aminotransferase elevations with jaundice or symptoms of liver injury, tucatinib should be promptly discontinued and not restarted. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the antineoplastic, small molecule enzyme and receptor inhibitors, but there is no information on shared adverse event sensitivity of tucatinib with other antineoplastic tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</p>
