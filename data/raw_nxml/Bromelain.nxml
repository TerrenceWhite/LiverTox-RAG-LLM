          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Bromelain is a concentrated mixture of proteolytic enzymes made from the stems and fruit of the pineapple plant (Ananas comosus) that has antiinflammatory and digestive properties, and is used topically to treat wounds and burns or orally for digestive complaints and sinusitis. Bromelain is typically concentrated, but only partially purified because its proteolytic enzymes can be inactivated by purification techniques. The major compounds in bromelain are enzymes such as is endopeptidases, phosphatases, glucosidases, peroxidases and cellulases and various glycoproteins. Applied topically, the proteolytic enzymes may help in wound debridement and burn management. In cooking, bromelain is used as a meat tenderizer. Orally, the enzymes and proteins of bromelain are absorbed intact to some degree and may possibly be helpful for digestive complains, infections and even metabolic problems. Bromelain has been used to treat symptoms of indigestion, nausea and abdominal pain as well as medical conditions including sinusitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, prostatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, bromelain has not been proven to be of convincing benefit for any condition and is not formally approved for use for any medical disease in the United States. Nevertheless, it is used orally in dietary supplements and topically to help in wound healing and debridement of dead tissue. Bromelain is approved in Europe for topical use in wound and burn management. Bromelain is available in many commercial herbal preparations alone and as a part of multiingredient dietary supplements. The dose varies by source and medical use between 200 and 2000 mg daily. Bromelain is generally recognized as safe (GRAS, according to the FDA definition), and side effects are uncommon and typically are mild degrees of abdominal discomfort and nausea. Hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria and rash have been reported but are usually mild and resolve rapidly with discontinuation. Rare instances of anaphylaxis have been described with its use.</p>

        <sec id="Bromelain.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Oral bromelain has been evaluated in more than 100 clinical trials for conditions such as sinusitis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis, and is usually described as well tolerated and without significant side effects or adverse events. These studies have rarely reported results of liver enzyme testing, and most studies were for short term use only (3 to 6 days) and included a limited number of subjects. Nevertheless, despite widespread use, there have been no reports of liver injury, jaundice or hepatotoxicity associated with oral or topical use of bromelain. In large case series, systematic reviews, and reports from pharmacovigilance registries on liver injury due to botanical products, bromelain has not been mentioned or listed.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
