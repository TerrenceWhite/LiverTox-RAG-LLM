          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and subsequently spread globally. By March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic and within a year it accounted for more than 100 million cases and 2 million deaths. Also, within a year of its detection, vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were developed using several methodologies including mRNA-, adenoviral vector- and recombinant DNA-technology. Several of these vaccines have been evaluated in large, placebo-controlled trials and found to be both safe and effective. Adverse events have been mild-to-moderate local reactions and transient systemic symptoms such as fatigue, nausea and headache. After their release and widespread use, however, individual case reports and small case series of serious adverse events began to appear including thrombotic thrombocytopenia, that sometimes involved portal or hepatic vein thromboses and some degree of liver dysfunction, as well as acute liver injury, that often resembled autoimmune hepatitis. Both of these syndromes are rare and it is not clear whether they are coincidental with or a result of the recent COVID-19 vaccination.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="CovidVaccines.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>In December 2019, a cluster of cases of severe pneumonia of unknown cause was reported from Wuhan, China that was rapidly shown to be due to a novel coronavirus &#x02013; the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus distantly related to the SARS-CoV [1] agent that caused an epidemic of severe viral pneumonia in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that caused an epidemic of acute respiratory illness in the Middle East in 2012. The SARS-CoV-2 agent proved to be highly contagious, rapidly spreading worldwide, causing outbreaks of severe respiratory illness (COVID-19) and being labelled a pandemic within 4 months of its identification. COVID-19 infection appeared to be symptomatic in over 50% of persons, lead to acute hospitalization in 5% to 10%, and death from respiratory and multiorgan failure in 2%. Major efforts were made to quickly develop means for its control, treatment and prevention, including most importantly, vaccines against COVID-19.</p>
          <p>Three major approaches to vaccine development were rapidly successful: mRNA-, adenovirus vector-, and recombinant DNA-based technologies. All have been found to be effective in preventing infection but particularly in preventing severe illness, breakthrough infections usually being asymptomatic or mild-to-moderate in severity. The first two vaccines approved for use in the United States under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) were mRNA vaccines &#x02013; BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna). Following that, two highly effective adenovirus-based vaccines received emergency use authorization approval in Europe &#x02013; ChAdOx1.nCoV-19 (Oxford-Astra Zeneca) and the United States &#x02013; Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen-Johnson &#x00026; Johnson). A recombinant DNA produced protein vaccine has also been developed and is under clinical evaluation (NVX-CoV2373: Novavax). Furthermore, adenovirus vectored vaccines with reported efficacy have also been developed in Russia (Gam-COVID-Vac, Sputnik-V: ) and China (Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine) where conventional, inactivated viral vaccines have also been produced. COVID-19 vaccines are given by intramuscular injection, and an initial inoculation followed by a second dose 3 to 4 weeks later are recommended for most currently used (see Table below). Booster doses given 6 months after the initial course of two doses are also now being recommended in selected populations. For the Johnson &#x00026; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, a booster dose may be given 2 months after the initial single dose to individuals 18 years of age and older.</p>
          <p>The COVID-19 vaccines have been found to be generally safe. Common adverse events are mild-to-moderate in severity and self-limiting in course. Immediate local reactions of pain, redness and swelling are most frequent, occurring in 70% to 80% of vaccinees. Mild-to-moderate systemic reactions after 1 to 3 days are also common, occurring in 20% to 40% of vaccinees, and include fatigue, myalgias, headache, nausea and mental fogginess. In contrast, severe immediate, hypersensitivity reactions are rare, but can occur, for which reason a 15 minute period of observation is required after administration of vaccine to allow for prompt treatment of anaphylactic reactions.</p>
          <p>Subsequent to the approval, release and widescale use of COVID-19 vaccines, reports of rare but severe adverse events began to appear in individual case reports and small case series. Because these reactions were rare, occurring in 1:100,000 to 1:1,000,000 vaccinated persons and were known to occur spontaneously at low rates, it was difficult to demonstrate that these events were caused or induced by the COVID-19 vaccination rather than arising by chance. Most of the evidence for causality related to the temporal onset of the complication and plausible explanations for the association. Thus, instances of myocarditis, pericarditis, Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome, Bell&#x02019;s palsy, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, toxic epidermal necrolysis and other syndromes (some associated with minor serum aminotransferase elevations) have been reported arising within days or weeks after vaccination. Yet, in the large controlled trials of the vaccines, these syndromes were not found or they occurred at similar rates with placebo inoculations. In addition, many of these syndromes were found to occur after natural COVID-19 infection, usually at increased rates. Two such syndromes have had clinically apparent hepatic manifestations: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CovidVaccines.REF.1">1</xref>) vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, and (2) vaccine induced autoimmune hepatitis-like injury.</p>
          <p>Rare instances of vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) have been described after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines, particularly the adenovirus-based formulations. VITT is characterized by thrombotic episodes in unusual sites (such as the cerebral and splanchnic venous systems) arising 3 to 16 days after an initial dose of vaccine. The syndrome is marked by evidence of platelet activation, antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanion complexes, and thrombocytopenia &#x02013; features that are similar to heparin induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia but in the absence of heparin. VITT can be severe and potentially fatal. The frequency of this reaction is estimated to be approximately 1 per million exposures, most commonly in women below the age of 50 years (~7 per million exposures). Instances of severe portal, splenic and mesenteric vein thromboses due to VITT can be accompanied by evidence of mild-to-moderate hepatic injury and dysfunction, typically with serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase elevations without jaundice. The cause of this complication is unknown but may involve induction of platelet activating antibodies due to cross reactivity with antibodies induced by the adenoviral vector or by the modified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly, this syndrome appears to respond favorably to intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) infusions and anticoagulation with direct factor IX inhibitors and avoidance of heparin.</p>
          <p>The second serious hepatic adverse event that has been linked to COVID-19 vaccination is the appearance of acute liver injury typically with autoimmune features shortly after receipt of a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. The frequency of this syndrome is not well defined but probably averages no more than 1 per million vaccinees. It was reported initially with mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, but subsequently with adenovirus vector-formulations as well. The latency to onset is typically short, in some cases jaundice and symptoms arising within a few days of vaccination. The clinical features often resemble autoimmune hepatitis with marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, minimal increases in alkaline phosphatase values and presence of high titers of autoantibodies and elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (Case 1). Also typical is a protracted course of illness with prompt response to corticosteroid therapy. The long term consequences of this syndrome are unclear as most patients were still receiving immunosuppressive agents at the time of the case reports. Somewhat similar rare instances of autoimmune hepatitis have been reported after other viral vaccines, including against influenza A, and hepatitis A and B. Whether these cases represent vaccine induced or spontaneous autoimmune hepatitis arising in susceptible persons who just happened to receive a vaccine remains unclear. It is also unknown whether this syndrome is self-limited in course, as is typical of most cases of drug induced liver injury with autoimmune features, as opposed to a persistent, long lasting liver injury as is typical of spontaneous autoimmune hepatitis.</p>
          <p>The safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines in pediatric populations are now under evaluation, but both safety and efficacy appear to be similar in adolescents and children as in adults and COVID-19 vaccines for use in younger cohorts are now being approved. Finally, the long term efficacy of currently available vaccines is only partially known, as is the need for future booster injections, particularly using modifications of current vaccine formulations to broaden their efficacy against new, potentially more infectious, virulent and resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

        <sec id="CovidVaccines.BNT162b2_Tozinameran_Pfize">
          <title>BNT162b2, Tozinameran (Pfizer, BioNTech)</title>
          <p>BNT162b2, which has been given the generic name tozinameran and brand name Comirnaty, is a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, modified in amino acid sequence to keep it in a stable, pre-fusion configuration which is most likely to induce neutralizing antibody. The vaccine was produced rapidly after publication of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence using already established techniques including encapsulation of the mRNA in lipid nanoparticles that protect the mRNA from degradation by plasma RNAse and allow for its rapid uptake into host cells. Two doses of the vaccine (30 &#x000b5;g in 0.3 mL) are recommended, 3 weeks apart. The vaccine requires storage at ultra-low temperatures (-60<sup>o</sup> to -80<sup>o</sup> C) and, after thawing, no more than 30 days in temporary storage at 2<sup>o</sup> to 8<sup>o</sup> C and thus requires a rigorous cold temperature chain for distribution. In pilot studies, the vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic. In a large, multinational registration trial in more than 80,000 adults, the vaccine was 57% effective after the initial dose and 95% effective 7 days after the second dose in preventing clinically apparent COVID-19. Studies of large cohorts of adults given the vaccine after its approval demonstrated a similar level of efficacy (greater than 90%) in clinical practice, with similar efficacy rates in all categories of subjects (by age group, gender, race and ethnicity), although slightly lower in patients with multiple comorbidities and immunosuppressed individuals. In studies of cohorts over time, titers of antibody to COVID-19 spike protein were found to decrease, and instances of breakthrough infections were increasingly described. The waning of antibody after vaccination has led to recommendations for booster inoculations 6 months after the two primary inoculations.</p>
          <p>Importantly, the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was also found to be safe. Mild-to-moderate local reactions (pain, redness, swelling) arise in 70% to 80% of patients and are more frequent in younger subjects and with the second injection. Severe hypersensitivity reactions occurred but were rare (~1 per million recipients), usually arising within 15 minutes of the injection and often in persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions to vaccines. Systemic reactions arising 1 to 3 days after vaccination are also frequent but generally mild-to-moderate in severity and transient in course, occurring in 59% to 70% of persons receiving vaccine vs 34% to 47% receiving placebo. Severe adverse events are rare and most occurrences were judged to be unrelated to the vaccine. There were no deaths attributed to the vaccine and no severe hepatic reactions in the preregistration trials. Since FDA&#x02019;s emergency use authorization (EUA) of BNT162b2 in December 2020 and approval in August 2021, however, there have been rare reports of hepatic injury arising within days or weeks of receipt of the vaccine. The liver injury is typically hepatocellular and accompanied by high titers of autoantibodies (such as antinuclear antibody or smooth muscle antibody) and elevations in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and responding rapidly to corticosteroid therapy, as occurs in spontaneous autoimmune hepatitis (Case 1). This syndrome is rare and it is still unclear whether it is due to COVID-19 vaccine or is a coincidental, chance association with spontaneously occurring autoimmune condition due to the frequency of vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <title>mRNA-1273 (Moderna)</title>
          <p>The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273, is a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, modified in amino acid sequence to keep it in a stable, pre-fusion configuration most likely to induce neutralizing antibody. The vaccine was produced rapidly after publication of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence using already established techniques including encapsulation of the mRNA of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in lipid nanoparticles that protect the mRNA and allow for its rapid uptake into host cells. Two doses of the vaccine (100 &#x000b5;g in 0.5 mL) are recommended, 4 weeks apart. The vaccine requires storage at low temperatures (between -50&#x000b0;C and -15&#x000b0;C), but is stable for up to 30 days after thawing if kept at 2<sup>o</sup> to 8<sup>o</sup> C and thus requires a minimally demanding cold chain for distribution. In pilot studies, the vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic. In a large multinational registration trial in more than 30,000 adults, the vaccine was found to be 94% effective 14 days after the second dose in preventing clinically apparent COVID-19. Studies of large cohorts of adults given the vaccine after its approval and widescale use demonstrated similar level of efficacy (92% to 95%) in clinical practice, with similar efficacy rates across categories of patients (by age group, gender, race, and ethnicity). In study of cohorts over time, antibody titers to the COVID-19 spike protein were found to decrease and booster inoculations 6 months after the primary vaccination (perhaps with half of the initial dose) are now recommended.</p>
          <p>The mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine was also shown to be safe. Mild-to-moderate local reactions (pain, redness, swelling) arise in 84% to 89% of patients, being more frequent in younger subjects and with the second injection. Severe hypersensitivity reactions occur but are rare (~2.5 per million), usually arising within 15 minutes of the injection and most frequently in persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions to vaccines. Systemic reactions arising 1 to 3 days after vaccination are also frequent but generally mild-to-moderate in severity, occurring in 55% to 79% of persons. In contrast, severe adverse events are rare and most occurrences were judged to be unrelated to the vaccine. There were no deaths attributed to the vaccine and no severe hepatic reactions reported in the large, initial randomized controlled trials. Since the emergency use authorization of mRNA-1273 in December 2020, however, several reports of an autoimmune-like acute hepatitis have been reported arising within days or weeks of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. The liver injury is typically hepatocellular and accompanied by high titers of autoantibodies (such as antinuclear antibody and smooth muscle antibody) and elevations in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and responds rapidly to corticosteroid therapy as occurs in spontaneous autoimmune hepatitis. This syndrome is rare and it is still unclear whether it is due to the mRNA-1623 vaccine or is a coincidental, chance association with this spontaneously occurring autoimmune condition due to the frequency of vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <sec id="CovidVaccines.ChAdOx1_nCoV19_AZD1222_Oxf">
          <title>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, AZD1222 (Oxford, AstraZeneca)</title>
          <p>ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, also known as AZD1222 and now known as Vaxzevria, was developed at Oxford University and licensed to AstraZeneca for production, clinical evaluation and distribution. AZD1222 is an adenovirus vector based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection that has been licensed for use in Europe and Asia and is awaiting U.S. approval. The ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine employs an infectious but nonreplicating adenovirus to deliver the RNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in infected cells. This vaccine was rapidly produced soon after publication of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence using already established techniques that were used to develop vaccines for Ebola virus infection. The vaccine is given in two injections of 2.5 x 10<sup>8</sup> infectious chimpanzee adenoviruses in 0.5 mL 4 to 12 weeks apart. This form of COVID-19 vaccine can be stored at modestly cold temperatures (2<sup>o</sup> to 8<sup>o</sup> C) for 6 months. For this reason, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine promises to be particularly helpful in medical resource limited areas of the world. Pilot studies demonstrated that the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine was safe and effectively induced neutralizing antibody in almost all patients after a single inoculation. In large multinational trials it was found to be 67% effective after two doses in preventing clinically apparent COVID-19 and 87% effective in preventing severe COVID-19 illness. The vaccine was also shown to be safe, although mild-to-moderate local reactions (pain, redness, swelling) arose in 64% of patients, and were more frequent in younger subjects and with the second injection. Severe hypersensitivity reactions occurred but were rare (~1 per million recipients), usually arising within 15 minutes of the injection and often in persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions to vaccines. Systemic reactions arising 1 to 3 days after vaccination were also frequent but generally mild-to-moderate in severity occurring in 22% to 54% of persons. However, severe adverse events were rare and most were judged to be unrelated to the vaccine. In these studies there were no hepatic serious adverse reactions and no deaths attributed to vaccine.</p>
          <p>After approval in Europe, however, instances of a severe syndrome of thromboses in unusual sites (cerebral and splanchnic venous system) were reported. The thromboses were accompanied by evidence of activation of platelets, production of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanionic complexes and thrombocytopenia, a syndrome similar to heparin induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, but in the absence of heparin. More than 200 cases of this syndrome have been reported with an estimated frequency is 1 per 100,000 adult recipients, largely among women below the age of 55 among whom the rate is as high as 9 per 100,000 recipients. Referred to as vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), this syndrome has also been encountered after the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine (Janssen, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson) which was described shortly after its emergency use authorization in the United States. The cause of VITT appears to be the induction of platelet activating antibodies due to production of adenoviral protein-PF4 adducts or molecular mimicry between adenoviral proteins or modified SARS-Co-2 spoke protein and PF4. The thromboses can occur in deep veins in the extremities and in the lungs, sites of typical venous thromboses, but have also been described in unusual sites such as the cerebral venous sinus and splanchnic-portal system. Instances of portal and hepatic vein thromboses have been reported that can be associated with liver test abnormalities and hepatic dysfunction. However, most deaths from VITT have been attributed to intracerebral hemorrhage rather than liver disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. The syndrome appears to respond to therapy with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), corticosteroids and oral anticoagulants such as the direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban or rivaroxaban. Treatment with heparins and coumadin are contraindicated as they appear to exacerbate the problem. Details of the frequency, natural history, specific pathogenesis and management are still under intense study.</p>
          <p>Similar to the mRNA vaccines, ChAdOx1 has now been associated with rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury arising within days or weeks of the initial or second vaccine injection. The liver injury is typically hepatocellular and accompanied by autoimmune features such as high titers of autoantibodies (such as antinuclear antibody and smooth muscle antibody) and elevations in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels. The liver injury can be protracted but usually responds rapidly to corticosteroid therapy as occurs in spontaneous autoimmune hepatitis. This syndrome is rare and it is still unclear whether it is due to the ChAdOx1 vaccine or is a coincidental, chance association with this spontaneously occurring autoimmune condition due to the frequency of vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <title>Ad26.COV2.S, JNJ-78436735 (Janssen, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson)</title>
          <p>The Johnson &#x00026; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, also known as JNJ-78436735, is an adenovirus vector based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection that has been Emergency Use Authorization in the United States on February 27, 2021. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine employs an infectious but nonreplicating adenovirus to deliver mRNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to infected cells. This vaccine was rapidly produced soon after publication of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence using already established techniques that were used to develop vaccines for Ebola virus infection. This form of COVID-19 vaccine requires only a single injection and can be kept at modestly cold temperatures of 2<sup>o</sup> to 8<sup>o</sup> C for up to 3 months. For this reason, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine promises to be particularly helpful in medical resource limited areas of the world. Pilot studies demonstrated that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine was safe and effectively induced neutralizing antibody in a high proportion of patients after a single inoculation. In large multinational studies the vaccine was found to be to be 66% effective 7 days after a single dose in preventing clinically apparent COVID-19 and was 85% effective in preventing severe COVID-19 illness. In follow-up studies of vaccinated cohorts, however, the titers of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein have been found to decrease over time, which appears to underlie the occurrence of breakthrough infections after vaccination. For this reason, booster inoculations (using any of the approved COVID-19 vaccines) are now recommended for recipients of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, at least for individuals in high risk groups.</p>
          <p>The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine has been shown to be safe. Mild-to-moderate local reactions (pain, redness, swelling) arose in approximately 50% of patients, being more frequent in younger subjects and with the second injection. Severe hypersensitivity reactions occurred but were rare (~1 per million), usually arising within 15 minutes of the injection and often in persons with a history of anaphylactic reactions to vaccines. Systemic reactions arising 1 to 3 days after vaccination were also frequent but generally mild-to-moderate in severity occurring in 30% to 60% of persons. However, severe adverse events were rare and most were judged to be unrelated to the vaccine, although analysis found an excessive of thromboembolic effects in those receiving vaccine, including two cases in young individuals, one with transverse sinus thrombosis.</p>
          <p>After approval in the United States in February 2021, however, instances of a severe thrombotic events occurring in unusual sites (cerebral and splanchnic venous system) were reported. The thromboses were accompanied by evidence of activation of platelets, production of antibodies to platelet factor 4 (PF4)-polyanionic complexes and thrombocytopenia, a syndrome similar to heparin induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, but in the absence of heparin. While venous thromboses were most frequent, arterial thromboses were also reported. The syndrome was often severe and multiple fatalities were reported. Referred to as vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT), this syndrome has also been encountered after the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine, with more than 200 cases reported from Europe among approximately 20,000,000 recipients of the vaccine. The incidence of clinically apparent VITT appears to be similar after the Johnson &#x00026; Johnson Ad26.COV2.S vaccine having been reported in 12 patients among approximately 7 million vaccinees, with the rate in women below the age of 55 being approximately 1 per 100,000. The cause of VITT appears to be the induction of platelet activating antibodies due to molecular mimicry between adenoviral proteins and PF4 or production of adducts of adenoviral DNA or proteins and PF4. The syndrome appears to respond to therapy with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), corticosteroids and oral anticoagulants such as the direct factor Xa inhibitors, apixaban and rivaroxaban. Treatment with heparin and coumadin are contraindicated as they appear to exacerbate the problem. Details of the frequency, natural history, specific pathogenesis and management are still under intense study.</p>
          <p>Thus, Ad26.COV2.S vaccination has not been associated directly with liver test abnormalities or hepatotoxicity or induction of autoimmune hepatitis, but may lead to the rare complication of vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia which can be associated with portal vein thromboses and liver dysfunction.</p>

          <p>NVX-CoV2373, also known as Covovax, is a protein subunit vaccine containing recombinant modified SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein in a saponin based matrix adjuvant. The viral vaccine was produced by Novavax using standard recombinant techniques in baculovirus using the viral genome sequence published from China. In pilot studies, NVX-CoV2373 was immunogenic and safe with only mild-to-moderate local and transient systemic adverse reactions. In a large randomized, placebo-controlled trial, the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine was found to be 90% effective in preventing clinically apparent SARS-CoV-2 disease, and adverse event rates were similar to those reported for other COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, overall adverse event rates were higher among NVX-CoV2373 than placebo recipients, but serious adverse event rates were similar and less than 1%. Importantly, the vaccine is stable at temperatures of 2<sup>o</sup> to 8<sup>o</sup> C for several months and would be valuable for distribution in resource limited countries of the world. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine has yet to receive approval in the United States. There have been no reports of hepatic adverse events attributed to NVX-CoV2373, although the total clinical experience with the vaccine is limited.</p>

          <title>Gam-COVID-Vac, Sputnik-V (Gamaleya National Center, Russia)</title>
          <p>Gam-COVID-Vac or Sputnik-V is a heterologous adenoviral vector based vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection that uses two different adenoviruses (rAd26-S and rAd5-S), both being infectious but nonreplicating human adenoviruses that deliver the RNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to infected cells. The initial vaccine dose uses the rAd26-S vector and the second the rAd5-S vector, thereby avoiding possible neutralization by antibody responses to the initial adenovirus vector injection. This vaccine was developed at the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow soon after publication of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence using already established techniques that were used to develop vaccines for Ebola virus infection. In pilot studies, the vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic. In a large multicenter trial in 21,977 adults, the Sputnik-V vaccine was found to be 92% effective from the time of the second dose in preventing clinically apparent COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing severe cases. The vaccine was also safe, although mild-to-moderate local reactions (pain, redness, swelling) arose in 70% to 80% of patients. Systemic reactions such as fever, headache and fatigue arising 1 to 3 days after vaccination were also frequent but generally mild-to-moderate in severity occurring in 30% to 50% of persons. However, severe adverse events were rare and were no more frequent in vaccine vs placebo recipients. There were no deaths attributed to the vaccine and no severe hepatic reactions. Since approval of Sputnik-V in Russia and distribution elsewhere in the world, there have been no reports of severe adverse events or hepatotoxicity associated with its use. While Sputnik-V is an adenoviral vector based vaccine like the AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 nCOV-19 and the Johnson and Johnson Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccines, it has not been linked to cases of thrombotic thrombocytopenia that has been reported with the other adenoviral vector based COVID vaccines. Thus, liver injury from the Sputnik-V must be rare if it occurs at all.</p>

          <title>Sinopharm COVID-19 Vaccine (Sinopharm, Beijing) and Corona Vac (Sinovac)</title>
          <p>At least 5 different COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and approved for use in China including adenovirus vector based vaccines as well as conventional inactivated viral vaccines. For most there is little published on their efficacy and safety. Two of these vaccines (one from Sinopharm and another from Sinovac) have been approved by the World Health Organization as a part of their worldwide COVID-19 vaccination global initiative called COVAX. Central to the Chinese plan to vaccinate the majority of its citizens by 2022 are the Sinopharm, Beijing, and Sinovac Corona Vac vaccines, both of which are conventional inactivated viral vaccines. Results of clinical trials of their safety and efficacy from different areas of the world have claimed efficacy rates ranging from 50% to 91% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses. These vaccines are also being used in multiple other countries including Indonesia, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru and Mexico. The spectrum and frequency of adverse events following the Sinopharm and Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines have not been published, but the means of production would suggest that these vaccines are relatively safe and unlikely to cause liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="CovidVaccines.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism(s) by which COVID-19 vaccines might cause serum enzyme elevations or clinically apparent liver injury is not known. The breakdown of mRNA and recombinant proteins occurs intracellularly and results in the release of polypeptides, amino acids and nucleic acids none of which should cause hepatic injury. In cases of vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, portal and hepatic vein thromboses might induce some degree of hepatic dysfunction, but the thromboses and bleeding elsewhere are likely to overshadow any liver injury. The autoimmune hepatitis that has been described after COVID-19 vaccination has been linked to both mRNA and adenovirus based vaccines. It is unclear whether the autoimmune hepatitis is triggered by the vaccine or is a coincidental occurrence.</p>

        <sec id="CovidVaccines.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Patients who receive COVID-19 vaccines should be encouraged to report any new major symptoms or signs that arise within a month after vaccination. Patients who receive adenoviral vectored vaccines should be informed of the possibility of thrombotic events arising 5 to 16 days after administration (usually with the first dose) and investigated rapidly for the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenia.</p>

          <title>Case 1. Acute liver injury after COVID-19 vaccination.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CovidVaccines.REF.1">1</xref>)</title>
          <p>A 35 year old woman developed an acute hepatitis with autoimmune features 1 to 2 weeks after receiving a first dose of the Pfizer BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine. She was in general good health and was 3 months postpartum. Approximately one week after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, she developed pruritus followed by dark urine and then jaundice. She had no history of liver disease and her only medications were labetalol which had been started for gestation hypertension and was continued after delivery. She denied taking other medications including over-the-counter agents and herbal supplements. When seen in an emergency room approximately 13 days after vaccination, she was jaundiced and had mild hepatomegaly. Laboratory testing showed a total bilirubin of 4.8 mg/dL, ALT 2001 U/L, AST 754 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase 170 U/L. Tests for hepatitis A, B and C were negative as were tests for EBV, CMV, HSV1 and 2, and HIV infection. The ANA was strongly positive (1:1280) as were antibodies to double stranded DNA, while SMA, anti-LKM, ANCA and AMA were negative. Abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable, and endoscopic ultrasound showed no evidence of gallstones or biliary obstruction. A liver biopsy showed changes suggestive of autoimmune hepatitis with portal and lobular inflammation, focal necrosis, rosette formation, and marked interface hepatitis with lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils. There was scant fibrosis and no evidence of cirrhosis.</p>
          <p>Over the first few hospital days, serum bilirubin remained elevated and aminotransferase levels fluctuated, decreasing minimally (Table). Because of the autoantibodies and liver histology suggestive of an autoimmunity, prednisone [20 mg daily] was started. There was prompt improvement and when she was seen as an outpatient several weeks later, she was asymptomatic and liver tests were normal. The dose of prednisone was lowered and then stopped. Six weeks after stopping she remained asymptomatic and liver tests were normal.</p>

            <p>This was the initial case report of acute hepatitis with autoimmune features following and possibly caused by COVID-19 vaccination. After this publication, another dozen instances arising after mRNA- as well as adenovirus vector-based vaccines were soon reported in letters to the editor from around the world. Characteristic of the injury was the marked hepatocellular pattern of enzyme elevations, mild jaundice, presence of autoantibodies in high titer, an accompanying hypergammaglobulinemia, and histologic features of an acute, florid autoimmune hepatitis. Also characteristic was the rapid response to corticosteroid therapy. In this case, a prudent dose of prednisone was used, which was then tapered and ultimately discontinued. In follow up, the patient remained in remission, although further monitoring would be appropriate, as late relapses can occur after stopping immunosuppression in patients with typical spontaneous autoimmune hepatitis. A central question is whether the episode represented vaccine induced liver injury with autoimmune features, or an autoimmune hepatitis triggered by the viral vaccine, or a coincidental occurrence of spontaneous autoimmune hepatitis that happened to become clinically evident shortly after vaccination (and a few months after pregnancy). The clinical features were typical of autoimmune hepatitis. Whether autoimmune hepatitis is triggered by COVID-19 vaccination will require more experience with this complication as well as genetic and immunologic studies aimed at how vaccines stimulate autoimmunity. Thus, features of this syndrome suggest that the pathogenesis is <underline>indirect</underline>, caused by modulation of the immune system rather than direct although idiosyncratic injury to hepatocytes.</p>
