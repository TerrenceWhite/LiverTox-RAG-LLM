          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>L-glutamine is an essential amino acid and precursor of major intracellular antioxidant molecules that is used in high doses to prevent vaso-occlusive crises in patients with sickle cell disease. L-glutamine has not been associated with serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to instances of idiosyncratic acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="L-Glutamine.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>L-glutamine (el gloo&#x02019; ta mene) is a conditionally essential amino acid that is approved for use in the treatment of sickle cell disease to prevent painful crises. Sickle cell disease is caused by an inherited mutation in the &#x003b2; globin gene that creates hemoglobin S, an abnormal form of hemoglobin which is prone to polymerization with deoxygenation resulting in sickling of red blood cells, hemolytic anemia, vascular occlusion of small vessels causing ischemic tissue and organ injury and recurrent painful crises. Sickle cell disease affects at least 100,000 Americans and is most common in persons of African descent. Long term complications include disability due to recurrent painful crises, acute chest syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, stroke and cerebral infracts, end-organ damage and early mortality. L-glutamine appears to act in decreasing painful crises in sickle cell disease by increasing levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and glutathione, essential molecules in intracellular oxidative-reductive balance and metabolism. Sickled red cells appear to have decreased levels of reduced NAD and are susceptible to oxidative stress. Oral administration of L-glutamine can restore NAD levels towards normal. In a single, randomized controlled trial in patients with frequent sickle cell crises, high oral doses of pharmaceutic grade L-glutamine was associated with a decrease in the number of pain crises and hospitalizations, but had no effects on hemoglobin levels or reticulocyte counts. Based upon that single study, L-glutamine was approved in the United States in 2019 as therapy for sickle cell disease in adults and children 5 years or older. L-glutamine is available in powdered form in packets of 5 grams under the brand name Endari. The recommended dose, mixed with 8 oz. of beverage, varies by body weight, with twice daily doses of 5 grams if &#x0003c;30 kg, 10 grams if 30-65 kg, and 15 grams if &#x0003e;65 kg. Side effects can include fatigue, muscle and back pain, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, cough and non-cardiac chest pain.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="L-Glutamine.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In clinical trials of L-glutamine in patients with sickle cell disease, serum aminotransferase elevations were not mentioned, and there were no reports of clinically apparent liver injury. Patients with sickle cell disease frequently have jaundice, largely due to chronic hemolysis which raises serum indirect bilirubin levels. They also can have fluctuating liver test abnormalities due to complications of sickle cell disease, such as gall stone disease (from chronic hemolysis), viral hepatitis and iron overload (from blood transfusions), congestive liver disease (due to pulmonary hypertension), and veno-occlusive crises involving the liver which can be associated with serum aminotransferase elevations and hepatic dysfunction. In preregistration trials of L-glutamine, hepatic events were not reported and serious adverse events were no more common with the active drug than with placebo. L-glutamine is a normal constituent of virtually all tissues and is unlikely to have intrinsic toxicity, even in high doses.</p>
          <p>Glutamine supplementation has a potential of worsening hepatic encephalopathy in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia which can overwhelm the hepatic elimination of ammonia in patients with severe liver dysfunction. Ingestion of 10 to 20 grams of glutamine has been shown to cause elevations of serum ammonia levels and to worsen psychometric measures of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Plasma ammonia levels do not increase with glutamine supplementation in patients with normal hepatic function, and its effects in patients with cirrhosis is not due to hepatic injury. Nevertheless, use of L-glutamine should be avoided in patients with sickle cell disease and advanced cirrhosis.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of acute liver injury with jaundice).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="L-Glutamine.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which L-glutamine might cause liver injury is unknown. L-glutamine is an amino acid that is used in protein synthesis in virtually all tissues and organs.</p>

        <sec id="L-Glutamine.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Elucidating the cause of liver test abnormalities in patients with sickle cell disease on therapies to prevent vaso-occlusive crises is difficult, as they are susceptible to several forms of liver injury including acute viral hepatitis, hemosiderosis, gallstone disease, congestive hepatopathy and ischemic liver injury from hepatic sickling crises.</p>
