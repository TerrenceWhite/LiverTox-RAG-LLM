          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Fezolinetant is an orally available neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist that is used to treat women with vasomotor symptoms (such as hot flashes) due to menopause. Fezolinetant is associated with a low rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and has been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Fezolinetant.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Fezolinetant (fez oh&#x02019; lin eh tant) is a neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor antagonist that is used to treat moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. The neurokinin 3 receptor is found on neurons in the thermoregulatory center of the brain, is activated by binding to neurokinin B, and is inhibited by circulating estrogen levels. During menopause, estrogen levels fall, and neurokinin B binding is unopposed, which leads to altered thermoregulation manifested by hot flashes, episodes of sensations of heat in the upper body lasting 1 to 5 minutes arising multiple times per day and which can be accompanied by flushing, chills, perspiration, clamminess and anxiety, symptoms that can interfere with activities of daily living and quality of life. Conventional therapy of menopausal vasomotor symptoms is estrogen replacement, which is effective but can be associated with adverse events including an increased risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. Fezolinetant is a small molecule, nonhormonal inhibitor of neurokinin binding and has been shown to decrease both the frequency and the severity of the vasomotor symptoms. Fezolinetant was approved for use in the United States in 2019 and is available in tablets of 45 mg under the brand name Veozah. The recommended dose is 45 mg daily. Current indications are for moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms due to menopause. Contraindications include cirrhosis, end-stage renal disease, and concurrent therapy with inhibitors of CYP 1A2, the cytochrome P450 enzyme primarily responsible for its metabolism. Fezolinetant is generally well tolerated. Side effects can include serum aminotransferase elevations, abdominal pain, diarrhea, insomnia, and back pain.</p>

        <sec id="Fezolinetant.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In preregistration clinical trials, serum ALT or AST elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 2.3% of patients taking fezolinetant vs 0.9% of placebo recipients. The elevations were largely asymptomatic and transient, resolving promptly after stopping therapy and sometimes despite drug continuation. Nevertheless, the elevations appeared to be related to therapy and arose most frequently during the first few months of treatment. More striking elevations arose in early phase trials using higher doses of fezolinetant. Bilirubin elevations were rare and there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice in preregistration clinical studies even with high doses. However, within a year of its approval, a case of mixed-cholestatic hepatitis with symptoms and jaundice occurred in a patient taking fezolinetant. The episode arose within 54 days of starting fezolinetant and resolved once the drug was stopped. Because of this case, the warning about drug induced liver injury was strengthened, and more explicit recommendations were made regarding prescreening and monitoring patients in the product label of fezolinetant.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>

        <sec id="Fezolinetant.Mechanism_of_Liver_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Liver Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which fezolinetant might cause liver injury is unclear, but it may be dose related and direct hepatotoxicity. Fezolinetant is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP 1A2 and inhibitors of this isoenzyme (such as cimetidine and ciprofloxacin) can result in higher drug levels and possibly increased rate of adverse events.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Fezolinetant.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for fezolinetant has a warning about drug induced liver injury and recommends assessing symptoms and laboratory features of liver disease before starting therapy and monitoring routine liver tests thereafter monthly for 3 months, again at 6 and 9 months, thereafter if signs of symptoms of liver injury arise. Fezolinetant should be discontinued if ALT or AST levels rise to above 5 times ULN or above 3 times ULN if symptoms or jaundice are present. Patients found to have serum aminotransferase elevations should be followed more carefully until they resolve. Fezolinetant is contraindicated in women with cirrhosis or renal failure and should be used with caution in those with liver test abnormalities at baseline.</p>
