          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is neurodevelopment condition marked by variable degrees of inattention, inability to concentrate or focus, impulsivity and hyperactivity that are inconsistent with developmental levels and that impair daily life. ADHD is the most common neurodevelopment disorder of children and persists into adulthood in at least 20% of cases. Approximately 9% of children in the United States are affected by ADHD and its incidence appears to be rising. ADHD has major effects on learning and academic achievement as well as social interactions and occupational success.</p>
          <p>Pharmacologic therapies can alleviate many of the symptoms of ADHD, but they are not always well tolerated. Currently approved drugs for ADHD are separated into those that are neurostimulatory (amphetamines and methylphenidate) versus nonstimulatory (clonidine, guanfacine, atomoxetine, and viloxazine). Amphetamines used to treat ADHD include miscellaneous specific forms such as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine as well as mixtures of amphetamines (Adderall and other generics). Methylphenidate is perhaps the most commonly used agent in treatment of ADHD and is available in short-, immediate-, and long-acting formulations generically and under the brand name Ritalin. Both amphetamines and methylphenidate are schedule II controlled substances, indicating that they have a high potential for abuse but a recognized medical usefulness. Nonstimulatory agents for ADHD are not controlled substances and do not have a potential for abuse. Guanfacine and clonidine are alpha-2 adrenergic agonists and were originally approved for treatment of hypertension and were later repurposed as therapy for ADHD. Atomoxetine and viloxazine are selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors both of which have also been used to treat depression, although neither is approved for this indication in the United States.</p>
          <p>Most drugs used to treat ADHD have no or minimal hepatotoxicity when given in therapeutic doses. The amphetamines and methylphenidate can cause liver injury when given in high doses or as an overdose. Methylphenidate and atomoxetine have also been implicated in rare cases of idiosyncratic liver injury with therapeutic doses. In contrast, guanfacine and clonidine have not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury despite years of clinical experience with their use. Finally, viloxazine, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and modulator of serotonin receptor activity has recently been approved for ADHD and has not been linked to clinically apparent instances of acute liver injury.</p>
          <p>An important factor in management of ADHD is that behavioral therapies are recommended as the first line of therapy, particularly for children and adolescents, and pharmacologic treatment should complement rather than replace behavioral therapy. These interventions include parent training and classroom interventions for children and adolescents. These behavioral therapies may allow for clinical improvements with lower doses of medications for ADHD.</p>
          <p>The medications currently approved as therapy for ADHD are each discussed in detail in the specific chapters in LiverTox, links to which are provided below. Each chapter has an annotated bibliography of references to the specific agents, while general references are provided in the Annotated Bibliography given with this Overview.</p>
