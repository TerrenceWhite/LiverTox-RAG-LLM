          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Nintedanib is an orally available tyrosine kinase receptor antagonist that inhibits collagen formation and is used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Elevations in serum enzyme levels during nintedanib therapy are not uncommon and multiple instances of acute liver injury with symptoms and jaundice have been reported since its approval and more widescale use.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Nintedanib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Nintedanib (nin ted' a nib) is a small molecular weight tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that has potent activity against several growth factor receptors, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). The inhibition of these receptors causes modulation of many intracellular pathways including inhibition of activities of pro-fibrotic mediators such as transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;), and decrease in synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins including collagen and fibronectin. Nintedanib has been evaluated as therapy for many different forms of fibrotic lung diseases as well as several forms of cancer. In several large clinical trials, therapy with nintedanib was associated with a decrease in the progressive decline in lung function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, as well as with a decrease in symptomatic, acute pulmonary exacerbations. On the basis of these studies, nintedanib was approved for use in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in the United States in 2014 and subsequently for other chronic fibrotic lung diseases such as systemic sclerosis associated lung disease and other chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases. However, it has not been approved for use in cancer. Nintedanib is available as capsules of 100 and 150 mg generically and under the brand name OFEV. The typical initial dose in adults is 150 mg orally twice daily. Temporary or permanent dose reduction is advised for management of adverse reactions or poor tolerability. Side effects are common and include diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, headache and fatigue. Rare, but potentially severe adverse events include excessive bleeding, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal perforation, liver injury, embryo-fetal toxicity, and arterial thrombotic events.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Nintedanib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In large preregistration randomized controlled trials, serum enzyme elevations occurred in 8% to 16% of patients receiving nintedanib compared to 3% of controls. Aminotransferase values above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in only 3% to 5% of patients (compared to &#x0003c;1% of controls), and discontinuation of therapy because of ALT elevations was required in less than 1% of nintedanib treated subjects. The enzyme elevations during nintedanib therapy were generally not accompanied by symptoms of liver injury or jaundice and resolved even without dose modification in many subjects. Subsequent to the approval of nintedanib as therapy for fibrotic pulmonary diseases, several reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributable to its use were published from Asia, Europe, and the United States. In reported cases, the latency to onset ranged for 4 to 24 months and the pattern of enzyme elevations ranged from cholestatic to hepatocellular. Fatal cases have been reported to the sponsor and to the FDA, but details of the liver injury were not well defined and the causality was often only possible or at most probable. Analysis of rates of ALT and AST elevations during nintedanib therapy have been reported to be as high as 68%, but usually self-limited and not accompanied by jaundice. Injury appears to be more frequent in the elderly, in Asians, and in patients with lower body weight and body surface area. Starting treatment at 100 mg twice daily and dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily appears to be associated with lower rates of aminotransferase elevations.</p>
          <p>These reports, however, led to revisions of the product label that now include warnings of liver injury that could be severe and even fatal. Warnings were also added to use caution in treating patients with concurrent known liver disease. Monitoring of liver tests are recommended by expert panels at baseline and at least monthly for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. Thus, nintedanib is likely to cause clinically apparent liver injury, and careful monitoring and early discontinuation (as was done in the preregistration studies) may prevent its occurrence.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: C (probable cause of clinically apparent liver injury that can be severe and even fatal).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Nintedanib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which nintedanib might cause liver injury is not known. It is metabolized in the liver largely via the cytochrome P450 system and idiosyncratic liver injury may be due to its metabolism to a toxic or immunogenic intermediate. Comparison of clinical features of patients with and without hepatic injury during nintedanib therapy suggests that hepatic enzyme elevations are more frequent in patients with a low body weight and body surface area suggesting that pharmacokinetic features may underlie risk for injury, which would explain the higher rates in the elderly and in Asians. Nintedanib is also susceptible to drug-drug interactions with strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP 3A4.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Nintedanib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>While chronic therapy with nintedanib can be associated with transient mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations, it can also result in clinically apparent liver injury. Current recommendations are for monitoring of serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels monthly during the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter as needed. Patients who develop aminotransferase elevations on therapy should be monitored more carefully and considered for dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily with close follow up. Nintedanib therapy should be discontinued if jaundice or symptoms of liver injury arise or if serum ALT or AST levels rise above 5 times the ULN.</p>
