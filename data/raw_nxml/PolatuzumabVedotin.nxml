          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Polatuzumab vedotin is a humanized monoclonal antibody conjugate which is used in the therapy of diffuse large B cell or high grade B cell lymphomas. Polatuzumab vedotin has been linked to transient mild-to-moderate serum enzyme elevations during therapy but has not been implicated in cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="PolatuzumabVedotin.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Polatuzumab (pol&#x0201d; a tooz&#x02019; ue mab) vedotin (ve doe&#x02019; tin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody to the human CD79b cell surface marker which is highly expressed on rapidly dividing B cells and B cell precursors. The monoclonal antibody is conjugated using a linker sequence to a cytotoxic molecule, vedotin, a small molecule anti-mitotic agent also known as monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). When polatuzumab vedotin binds to CD7b, it is internalized and the vedotin is released by the action of lysosomal enzymes which cleave the short linker molecule that joins the antibody and the cytotoxic molecule. The intracellular vedotin binds to microtubules preventing their participation in cell division resulting in apoptotic cell death of the rapidly dividing malignant B cells. This monoclonal antibody conjugate has been shown to be effective in inducing remissions in adults with diffuse large B cell and high grade B cell lymphomas when given with rituximab-based chemotherapeutic regimens and was given accelerated approval for these indications in the United States in 2019. Polatuzumab vedotin is available in powder for reconstitution in single dose vials of 30 and 140 mg under the brand name Polivy. The typical recommended dose regimen is 1.8 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion once every 21 days for 6 cycles. Premedication before each infusion with antihistamines and antipyretics is recommended. Polatuzumab vedotin is given in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) for previously untreated diffuse large B cell and high-grade B cell lymphomas and in combination with rituximab and bendamustine for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Side effects are common with these regimens, not all of which are due to the polatuzumab. Adverse effects may include infusion reactions, nausea, abdominal pain, anorexia, weakness, fatigue, headache, itching and rash. Less common, but potentially serious side effects included peripheral neuropathy, hypersensitivity reactions, severe myelosuppression, serious opportunistic infections, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, tumor lysis syndrome, hepatotoxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Polatuzumab vedotin should be administered only by physicians and health care providers with training and expertise in cancer chemotherapy and management of its potential adverse effects.</p>

        <sec id="PolatuzumabVedotin.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In publications of the initial registration trials of polatuzumab vedotin, rates of serum aminotransferase and bilirubin elevations were not provided. In the FDA multidiscipline review of an expanded safety population, however, cases of marked serum aminotransferase elevations arose in 3.8% of recipients of polatuzumab vedotin and of concurrent elevations of serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels in 2.3%. However, other causes of the abnormalities were often found. Nevertheless, monitoring of serum enzymes and bilirubin is recommended in the product label. After its approval and more widespread use, there have been no instances of clinically apparent liver injury reported in the literature, but instances of suspected liver injury from polatuzumab vedotin have been reported to the FDA.</p>
          <p>Because polatuzumab is an immunosuppressive agent with specific activity against B cells, it may pose a risk for reactivation of viral infections including hepatitis B. While there were no reports of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in the preregistration trials of polatuzumab vedotin, patients with known chronic HBV infection were excluded from enrollment.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (suspected but unproven cause of clinically significant liver injury and possibly reactivation of hepatitis B).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="PolatuzumabVedotin.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of the serum aminotransferase elevations during polatuzumab vedotin therapy is not known, but it is likely due to direct toxicity of the vedotin conjugate rather than the monoclonal antibody. Because polatuzumab is given with multiple other cytotoxic antineoplastic agents (such as rituximab, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin or bendamustine), the liver test abnormalities may be due to the other agents being used.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="PolatuzumabVedotin.Outcome_and_Managemen">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase elevations that occur during polatuzumab vedotin therapy are generally transient, mild and asymptomatic and do not require dose modification or delay in therapy. Elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal, if detected, should lead to more careful monitoring and suspension of further infusions, at least until levels return to normal or near normal levels. Elevations above 20 times the ULN or any elevation accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should lead to prompt permanent discontinuation. Because polatuzumab vedotin is at least theoretically capable of inducing reactivation of hepatitis B, it is appropriate to test patients for HBsAg and anti-HBc before initiating therapy, and if markers are present, monitoring patients for HBV markers (HBV DNA, HBsAg) regularly or providing prophylaxis with antiviral agents active against HBV (tenofovir or entecavir) during therapy.</p>
