          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Daprodustat is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase that is used to treat the anemia of chronic renal disease in patients on dialysis. Daprodustat is associated with a low rate of transient and usually mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy but has yet to be linked to cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Daprodustat.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Daprodustat (dap&#x0201d; roe doo&#x02019; stat) is an orally available, specific inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase that is used to treat patients with anemia and chronic renal disease on dialysis. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; and 1&#x003b2; are subunits of a heterodimeric small transcription factor HIF1, which are constitutively produced at low levels, and in response to hypoxia they are free to dimerize and induce the expression of genes that cause increase in erythropoietin and subsequent increase in hemoglobin. With normal oxygen tension, propyl hydrolase inactivates HIF1&#x003b1; and causes its degradation preventing it from dimerizing with HIF 1&#x003b2;, and as a result erythropoiesis is not increased. By inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase, daprodustat mimics hypoxic conditions and causes an increase in erythropoietin and increased erythropoiesis. In several animal models of chronic renal disease and anemia, daprodustat was found to increase erythropoietin and hemoglobin levels. In an open label trial in adult patients with chronic renal disease and anemia who were on dialysis, daily oral doses of daprodustat resulted in increases in hemoglobin levels similar to those induced by injections of recombinant forms of erythropoietin. A similar result was shown in renal disease patients with anemia who were not on dialysis, but in this group, there was a slight but significant increase in cancers, increased tumor progression, and cancer recurrences with daprodustat in comparison to recombinant erythropoietin. Based upon these results, daprodustat was given accelerated approval as therapy of adults with renal disease and anemia but only those who were on dialysis. Daprodustat is available in tablets of 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mg under the brand name Jesduvroq. The recommended starting dose is based upon hemoglobin levels, liver function, and concomitant medications. The dose is then adjusted based upon hemoglobin levels and tolerance (maximum 24 mg once daily). Adverse events are frequent in patients with renal failure on hemodialysis, but adverse events that appear more frequently on daprodustat therapy include hypertension, gastrointestinal erosions, hypersensitivity reactions, and rash. Uncommon and potentially severe adverse events include retinal hemorrhage, thromboembolic events (such as vascular access thrombosis and cerebral infarction), increase risk of death from myocardial infarction or stoke, worsening of heart failure, and possibly increased risk of malignancy. These uncommon but severe adverse events may also be increased with chronic therapy with erythropoietin.</p>

        <sec id="Daprodustat.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the open label prelicensure clinical trials of daprodustat in patients with renal disease, serum aminotransferase elevations 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or above occurred in 1.7% of subjects, and elevations of 5 times ULN or above in 1.1%. However, similar rates of ALT and AST elevations occurred in placebo and erythropoietin treated participants. The elevations were typically mild and transient and there were no instances of serum aminotransferase elevations with jaundice that were attributed to daprodustat therapy. Since approval and more widescale availability of daprodustat, there have been no published reports of clinically apparent liver injury associated with its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Daprodustat.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of mild serum enzyme elevations during daprodustat therapy is not known but is possibly due to the underlying chronic renal disease, its management, and complications. Daprodustat is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 system, predominantly CYP 2D8, and serum levels can be affected by agents that inhibit (such as gemfibrozil and clopidogrel) or induce (such as rifampin) this microsomal drug metabolizing enzyme.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Daprodustat.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Monitoring of serum aminotransferase levels and routine liver tests is recommended for patients starting daprodustat, and liver chemistries should be repeated during therapy if symptoms or signs of liver injury arise. De novo elevations in serum aminotransferase levels above 5 times the upper limit of normal should lead to at least temporary cessation of drug and search for other causes. If serum enzyme elevations do not resolve or if symptoms of liver injury or jaundice arise, daprodustat should be discontinued.</p>
