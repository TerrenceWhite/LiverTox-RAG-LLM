          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Istradefylline is an adenosine receptor antagonist that is used as adjunctive therapy to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson disease experiencing difficulty with &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; episodes when motor symptoms breakthrough on treatment. Istradefylline has been associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Istradefylline.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Istradefylline (is&#x0201d; tra def&#x02019; i lin) is an adenosine [A<sub>2A</sub>] receptor antagonist that acts independently of dopaminergic pathways, reducing the overactive striatopallidal output that results in increased GABAergic inhibitory activity. Levodopa/carbidopa is the mainstay of therapy of Parkinson disease increasing brain dopamine levels and typically alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease for 5 to 6 hours. After the first 2 to 5 years of therapy, however, the duration of benefit becomes shorter (wearing off effect), and patients develop fluctuations between mobility and immobility (on-off effect). Patients with Parkinson disease and motor complications have been found to have overactive striatopallidal output. For this reason, istradefylline was assessed in animal models where it was found to decrease striatopallidal output and the resultant excessive GABAergic activity. In clinical trials, istradefylline when given in combination with levodopa/carbidopa decreased the wake-time &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; episodes in patients with Parkinson disease. Initially, applications for approval of istradefylline were rejected by the FDA because of its modest effects; it was, however, approved in Japan. In 2019, based upon further studies and demonstration of safety, istradefylline was approved in the United States for use as adjunctive therapy to levodopa for adults with Parkinson disease who were experiencing &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; episodes. Istradefylline is currently available as tablets of 20 and 40 mg under the brand name Nourianz. The recommended dose is 20-40 mg once daily. While istradefylline may improve control of symptoms, there is no evidence that it slows the progression of Parkinson disease. Common side effects include dyskinesia, dizziness, constipation, nausea, and insomnia. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include hallucinations, psychotic and compulsive behaviors, hypersexuality, and severe dyskinesia.</p>

        <sec id="Istradefylline.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In prelicensure controlled trials, serum ALT elevations occurred in 4% to 11% of istradefylline-treated subjects compared to 5% to 6% of placebo recipients, most of whom were taking multiple other agents for Parkinson disease. The elevations were usually mild-to-moderate in severity, asymptomatic and self-limited in course. ALT elevations above 3 times the ULN occurred in less than 1% recipients and rarely led to discontinuation. None of the aminotransferase elevations were accompanied by symptoms or jaundice. In preregistration clinical trials and subsequently with its more widespread use, istradefylline has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury. It has, however, had limited clinical use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Istradefylline.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Istradefylline is a specific antagonist of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors and a first-in-class agent. The mechanism by which it might cause liver injury is not known. It is metabolized in the liver, largely via CYP 3A4 and 1A1 and is sensitive to drug-drug interactions with strong inducers or inhibitors of the CYP 3A4 microsomal enzyme. Thus, hepatotoxicity might be caused by metabolic idiosyncrasy that produces a toxic or immunogenic byproduct of metabolism.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Istradefylline.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Istradefylline has been linked to mild-to-moderate serum enzyme elevations during therapy. Discontinuation for serum enzyme elevations is rarely necessary, but should be done if the elevations are accompanied by symptoms or jaundice or for ALT elevations of more than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). There is no information on cross sensitivity to liver injury between istradefylline and other agents used in the therapy of Parkinson disease.</p>
