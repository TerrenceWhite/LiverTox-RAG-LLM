          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tralokinumab is a human monoclonal antibody to IL-13 which is used to treat atopic dermatitis. Tralokinumab is generally well tolerated and has not been linked to elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy or to instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Tralokinumab.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tralokinumab (tral&#x02019; oh kin&#x02019; ue mab) is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody directed against IL-13, a major mediator of chronic inflammation and which is over-expressed and a dominant cytokine in lesional skin cells in atopic dermatitis. Tralokinumab has been assessed in several chronic inflammatory diseases, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and ulcerative colitis, and while demonstrating little positive benefit in these conditions, was found to be well tolerated with adverse event rates similar to those with placebo. In contrast, preregistration randomized, placebo controlled trials of tralokinumab in patient with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis demonstrated significant response rates with tralokinumab alone as well as in combination with topical corticosteroids. Clinical responses were generally maintained with long term therapy. Tralokinumab was approved in the United States in 2021 for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies. Tralokinumab is available in single dose pre-filled syringes of 150 mg in 1 mL under the brand name Adbry. The recommended regimen is an initial dose of 600 mg (4 syringes) subcutaneously followed by 300 mg (two syringes) every other week, which can be extended to every 4 weeks with long term use. Common side effects include mild local injection reactions, nasopharyngitis, fatigue, headache, arthralgia, skin rashes, conjunctivitis and eosinophilia. Uncommon, potentially severe adverse reactions include hypersensitivity reactions, keratitis, parasitic infections and risk of infection with viruses found in live attenuated vaccines.</p>

        <sec id="Tralokinumab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations arise in less than 1% of patients treated with tralokinumab, and such abnormalities are generally transient, asymptomatic, and rarely necessitate drug discontinuation. In most trials, serum ALT elevations occurred at similar rates in placebo recipients. In large, preregistration trials there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury or severe hepatic adverse events attributed to tralokinumab. Since its approval and more general use, there have been no reports of clinically significant liver injury attributed to tralokinumab. Whether reactivation of hepatitis B might occur with tralokinumab therapy has yet to be reported. It has been associated with reactivation of herpes zoster.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tralokinumab.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The possible mechanisms of liver injury due to tralokinumab are unclear. Monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulins are generally taken up and metabolized intracellularly to short peptides and amino acids. There is no evidence to suggest that inhibition of IL-13 signaling would trigger liver injury or autoimmune liver conditions.</p>
