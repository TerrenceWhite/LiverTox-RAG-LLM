          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Pegcetacoplan is a small peptide inhibitor of complement that is used to treat adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Serum aminotransferase elevations occur in a proportion of patients treated pegcetacoplan, but episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice have not been reported with its use.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pegcetacoplan.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Pegcetacoplan (peg set&#x02019; a koe&#x02019; plan) is a subcutaneously administered small peptide inhibitor of complement C3 and its activation fragment C3b that blocks the cleavage of C3 and the downsteam effectors of completement activation. Pegcetacoplan is used in conditions marked by excessive activation of complement including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), age-related macular degeneration, and some forms of glomerulonephritis. PNH is a rare, acquired disease caused by lack of the regulatory proteins CD55 and CD59 on the surface of red blood cells. Without these factors, the red cells are susceptible to complement activation, which causes episodes of hemolysis and thromboses. Previous therapies for PNH included two monoclonal inhibitors of complement C5 (eculizumab and ranukinumab) which were effective in decreasing intravascular hemolysis but not extravascular hemolysis, which is the result of complement activation upstream of C5. In a prospective controlled trial in patients with only partial response to eculizumab, the switch to pegcetacoplan resulted in better control of the hemolytic anemia, higher hemoglobin levels, and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. Pegcetacoplan was also found to be superior to eculizumab as first line therapy of PNH na&#x000ef;ve to complement inhibitors. Pegcetacoplan was approved in the United States in 2021 for adults with PNH, either as initial therapy or after switching from intravenous eculizumab or ranukinumab. Pegcetacoplan is available in solution in single use vials of 1080 mg in 20 mL (54 mg/mL). The recommended dosage is 1080 mg administered by subcutaneous infusion twice weekly. The most common adverse events include injection site reactions, infections, diarrhea, abdominal pain, respiratory tract infections, pain, fatigue, cough, arthralgia, dizziness, headache, and rash, many of which are more likely due to the underlying condition than the therapy. Laboratory abnormalities include hypokalemia. Potential severe adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions and serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type B, for which reason pegcetacoplan has a boxed warning and recommendations for vaccination before starting therapy. An increase in risk of these infections has yet to be shown with use of pegcetacoplan in adult patients with PNH.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pegcetacoplan.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of pegcetacoplan in patients with PNH, ALT elevations were rarely described, and there were no reports of hepatic adverse events or discontinuations because of abnormal liver tests. Serum ALT and AST elevations are not uncommon in patients with untreated PNH, usually due to hemolysis, thromboses, or infections. In the open label and controlled trials supporting the approval of pegcetacoplan, there were instances of cholecystitis and portal vein thromboses, but no mention of drug induced liver injury. Since its approval in the United States and Europe, there have been no reported cases of clinically apparent liver injury associated with pegcetacoplan therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pegcetacoplan.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from pegcetacoplan is unknown but suspected to be due to the underlying hemolysis or thromboses and unrelated to therapy. Pegcetacoplan is comprised of two identical 15-aminoacid peptides covalently joined by a molecule of polyethylene glycol (PEG). It is metabolized by cellular peptidases into small peptide fragments which are unlikely to be harmful, immunogenic, or toxic. Pegcetacoplan is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and has no effect of CYP metabolizing enzymes.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pegcetacoplan.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for pegcetacoplan does not recommend routine monitoring of liver laboratory tests during therapy. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if detected) should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation of treatment with careful monitoring if restarted after resolution of the abnormalities. Elevations of aminotransferase levels accompanied by jaundice or symptoms of liver injury should trigger discontinuation of therapy. Cross sensitivity to liver injury has not been described with the other complement inhibitors used to treat PNH, eculizumab and ravulizumab.</p>
