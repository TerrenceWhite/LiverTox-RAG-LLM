          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tisotumab vedotin is a human monoclonal antibody conjugate which is used in the therapy of refractory, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Tisotumab vedotin has been linked to transient mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy but has not been implicated in cases of liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="TisotumabVedotin.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tisotumab vedotin (ti&#x0201d; so&#x02019; tue mab) vedotin (ve doe&#x02019; tin) is a human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody to tissue factor (TF), a cell surface protein that is highly expressed in various forms of cancer and is associated with poor outcomes. The monoclonal antibody is conjugated using a linker sequence to a cytotoxic molecule, vedotin monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) that disturbs microtubule formation resulting in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. When tisotumab binds to TF on cancer cells, it is internalized, and vedotin is released by the action of lysosomal enzymes which cleave the short linker molecule that joins the antibody and cytotoxin. Once released, the intracellular vedotin binds to microtubules preventing their participation in cell division resulting in in apoptotic cell death of the rapidly dividing malignant cells. This monoclonal antibody conjugate has been shown to be effective in inducing remissions in adults with refractory, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancers that express TF. Tisotumab vedotin was given accelerated approval for treatment of adults with refractory recurrent or metastatic forms of cervical cancer in the United States in 2021. Tisotumab vedotin is available in powder for reconstitution in single dose vials of 40 mg under the brand name Tivdak. The typical recommended dose is 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 200 mg) administered by intravenous infusion every three weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects are common and may include infusion reactions, fatigue, nausea, alopecia, epistaxis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, dry eyes, hemorrhage, constipation, diarrhea, and rash. Anemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and increases in serum creatinine and INR can also occur. Less common, but potentially serious side effects included peripheral neuropathy, hemorrhage, pneumonitis, severe cutaneous reactions including Stevens Johnson syndrome, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Tisotumab vedotin should be administered only by physicians and health care providers with training and expertise in cancer chemotherapy and management of its potential adverse effects.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="TisotumabVedotin.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In publications of the registration trials of tisotumab vedotin, serum aminotransferase elevations arose in 11% to 24% of treated patients but were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in only 1% to 2%, and no patient developed clinically apparent liver injury attributed to therapy. The conjugated vedotin is an active metabolite of irinotecan which is a well-known cause of hepatic steatosis and liver injury, but cases are rarely clinically apparent. Since its approval and more widespread use, there have been no instances of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to tisotumab vedotin reported in the literature.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically significant liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="TisotumabVedotin.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of the serum aminotransferase elevations during tisotumab vedotin therapy is not known, but it is likely due to direct toxicity of the vedotin conjugate rather than the monoclonal antibody. It is not known whether the serum enzyme elevations are accompanied by hepatic steatosis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="TisotumabVedotin.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase elevations that occur during tisotumab vedotin therapy are generally transient, mild and asymptomatic and rarely require dose modification or delay in therapy. Elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal, if detected, should lead to more careful monitoring and suspension of further infusions, at least until levels return to normal or near normal levels. Elevations above 20 times the ULN or any elevation accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should lead to prompt permanent discontinuation.</p>
