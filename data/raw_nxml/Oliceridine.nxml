          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Oliceridine is an intravenously administered, synthetic opioid that is used to treat moderate-to-severe pain not responsive to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Oliceridine is associated with a low rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Oliceridine.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Oliceridine (oh&#x0201d; li ser&#x02019; i deen) is an intravenously administered, synthetic opioid approved for use in moderate-to-severe acute pain in adults after surgery or painful procedures. Oliceridine is an agonist of the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor with a potency similar to that of morphine, but with post-receptor actions that are biased to G protein signaling and with less &#x003b2;-arrestin2 recruitment and receptor internalization. This bias in &#x003bc;-opioid receptor agonism was associated with fewer adverse effects in animal models, but this selectivity has been less well shown in humans. In several controlled trials, intravenous oliceridine was shown to be superior to placebo in controlling postoperative pain, but responses were numerically less than with morphine. Oliceridine was approved in the United States in 2020 for management of adults with acute pain severe enough to require intravenous opioid analgesia. Oliceridine is available in 1 and 2 mg single dose vials (1 mg/mL) and as a 30 mg single patient use vial of 30 mL (1 mg/mL) for patient-controlled analgesia. The common adverse events of oliceridine are similar to other opiates and include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, constipations, pruritus, and respiratory depression with hypoxia. The gastrointestinal adverse events appear to be less frequent and milder with oliceridine than with morphine. Severe adverse events include serious, life threatening or fatal respiratory depression particularly in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, the elderly, debilitated patients, and those on other CNS depressants. High doses of oliceridine may cause prolongation of the QTc interval and dosing should be limited to less than 27 mg daily. Oliceridine, like other opioid drugs, has a boxed warning for addiction, abuse, and misuse. Use of oliceridine during pregnancy may cause fetal harm and can result in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome.</p>

        <sec id="Oliceridine.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Serum ALT elevations developed in 1% to 3% of patients receiving oliceridine and in a similar proportion (2.4%) receiving morphine after abdominal surgery. However, the aminotransferase elevations were not associated with jaundice and were usually considered unrelated to therapy. Since approval of oliceridine, there have been no published reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Oliceridine.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Oliceridine like other opioid analgesics has not been associated with significant liver injury. The reasons for its lack of hepatotoxicity may relate to the short duration of therapy and the low doses used. Oliceridine is metabolized in the liver predominantly by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP 2D6 and 3A4).</p>

          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for oliceridine does not recommend screening or monitoring for routine liver tests before or during therapy.</p>
