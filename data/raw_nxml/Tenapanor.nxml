          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tenapanor is a small molecular inhibitor of the sodium/hydrogen ion exchanger-3 (NHE3) used to treat constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Tenapanor has minimal systemic absorption and has not been associated with serum enzyme elevation during therapy nor has it been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Tenapanor.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tenapanor (ten a&#x02019; pan or) is a small molecule inhibitor of the sodium-hydrogen exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) which is responsible for sodium absorption in the intestine with resultant passive uptake of water. Inhibition of the transporter results in an increase in osmotic secretion of water, shortening of intestinal transit time and softening of stool consistency. On the other hand, inhibition of the exchanger can also result in diarrhea and possibly dehydration. Tenapanor acts locally and has minimal absorption. Tenapanor was found to improve frequency <strike>numbers</strike> and completeness of bowel movements and symptoms of bloating and distension in patients with constipation-predominant IBS and was approved for this indication in adults in 2019. Tenapanor has also been evaluated as a means of reducing hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis, but has yet to be given approval for that indication. Tenapanor is available in tablets of 50 mg under the brand name Ibsrela, the recommended dose being 50 mg twice daily taken before breakfast and before dinner. Tenapanor has not been approved for treatment of children and is contraindicated in children below the age of 6 because of the risk of dehydration. Common side effects include diarrhea, abdominal distension, flatulence, and dizziness. Rare, but potentially severe adverse events include severe diarrhea and dehydration. Tenapanor has embryo-fetal toxicity in animals and should not be used in pregnancy.</p>

          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>When given orally, tenapanor has minimal systemic absorption and has not been associated with elevations in serum enzymes or bilirubin or with instances of clinically apparent liver injury. Since approval and general availability of tenapanor, there have been no published reports of liver injury attributed to its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
