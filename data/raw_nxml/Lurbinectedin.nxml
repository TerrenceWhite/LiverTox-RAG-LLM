          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Lurbinectedin is an antineoplastic alkylating agent and synthetic derivative of trabectedin that is used to treat refractory, metastatic small cell lung cancer. Lurbinectedin therapy is associated with a high rate of transient serum enzyme elevations during treatment and with occasional instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lurbinectedin.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Lurbinectedin (loor&#x0201d; bin ek&#x02019; te din) is a synthetic derivative of the natural product trabectedin that acts as an alkylating agent and is used in cancer chemotherapy. Lurbinectedin binds to the minor groove of DNA, allowing for alkylation of guanine causing double-strand DNA breaks and apoptotic cell death, particularly in the absence of viable DNA repair pathways. Lurbinectedin demonstrated cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines in vitro and in murine models of human small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Pilot studies and moderately sized, open label trials of lurbinectedin in patients with refractory, relapsed metastatic SCLC showed promising results with response rates of 35% overall. Lurbinectedin was given accelerated approval in 2020 as therapy of patients with metastatic SCLC after relapse following first line therapy with platinum based antineoplastic agents. Lurbinectedin is given intravenously and is available in 4 mg amounts of lyophilized powder in single use vials under the brand name Zepzelca. The typical dose is 3.2 mg/m<sup>2</sup> body surface area as a 60 minute infusion every 3 weeks, continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Premedication with dexamethasone and with serotonin antagonists (such as ondansetron) before each infusion is recommended. Side effects are common and include bone marrow suppression, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, fever, dyspnea, cough, infections, peripheral neuropathy, and headache. Serious adverse events include severe myelosuppression, neutropenic sepsis, hepatotoxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lurbinectedin.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Elevations in serum aminotransferase levels arise in approximately two-thirds of patients treated with lurbinectedin and elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal occur in 4% to 5% of patients. Pretreatment with dexamethasone appears to decrease the degree and frequency of enzyme elevations. The elevations arise within 2 to 5 days of the intravenous infusion, rise to maximal levels between 5 and 9 days, and generally fall to baseline values within 2 to 3 weeks. Minor elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are also common. However, clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice from lurbinectedin is uncommon. On the other hand, patients with underlying liver disease appear to be at increased risk for septicemia and multiorgan failure as a result of chemotherapy, and monitoring of liver tests before and during lurbinectedin therapy is recommended. The severe liver injury typically mimics acute decompensation of an underlying cirrhosis with modest elevations in serum enzymes and worsening jaundice and hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Immunoallergic and autoimmune features are uncommon. Fatalities are generally due to sepsis and multiorgan failure rather than typical acute liver failure.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible cause of clinically apparent liver injury, generally in the setting of preexisting liver disease and use of high doses).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lurbinectedin.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The transient serum aminotransferase elevations that occur with lurbinectedin therapy are most likely due to direct hepatotoxicity. Lurbinectedin is extensively metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 system, predominantly CYP3A4, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions. Agents that inhibit CYP3A activity may cause elevated levels of lurbinectedin and increased toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lurbinectedin.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The severity of liver injury from lurbinectedin ranges from mild elevations in liver enzymes to marked aminotransferase elevations to clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice and multiorgan (including hepatic) failure. Most severe cases occur in patients with preexisting liver disease. For these reasons, patients should be monitored with routine liver tests before and during therapy, and therapy delayed until resolution of the abnormalities, or stopped if liver test abnormalities persist.</p>
