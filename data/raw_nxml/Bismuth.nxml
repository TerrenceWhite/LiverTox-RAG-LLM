          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Bismuth is a brittle, silvery-white metal that is used in paints, cosmetics, electronics, and a few over-the-counter pharmaceuticals, usually as bismuth subsalicylate or subcitrate, primarily to treat diarrhea and digestive disorders. Currently, the major medical use of bismuth is as a component of quadruple therapy of Helicobacter pylori infection. There is scant evidence that bismuth, even in high doses, causes serum aminotransferase elevations or clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Bismuth.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Bismuth is silvery white metal similar to tin and lead that has many commercial uses and has long been used to treat indigestion and diarrhea. Bismuth is currently widely used in combination with antibiotics and omeprazole as &#x0201c;quadruple&#x0201d; therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, a major cause of peptic ulcer disease and possibly gastric carcinoma. Bismuth is found naturally as sulfide and oxide forms and is a common byproduct of lead refining. Bismuth is not an essential element and is rarely present in foods and then only in trace amounts. Nevertheless, bismuth has been used as a pharmaceutical agent typically to treat diarrhea and previously for various infections including syphilis. Currently, the major use of bismuth is in combination with at least two antibiotics and omeprazole in &#x0201c;quadruple&#x0201d; therapy for eradication of Helicobacter pylori. The mechanism of action of bismuth is not well defined, but in addition to providing a coating to ulcers and inflamed issue, bismuth has direct activity against H. pylori. Approved forms of bismuth include bismuth subcitrate potassium [140 mg] in fixed combination with metronidazole [125 mg] and tetracycline [125 mg] generically and under the brand name Pylera, and as bismuth subsalicylate [262 mg] in fixed combination with metronidazole [250 mg] and tetracycline [500 mg] generically and under the brand name Helidac. These fixed combinations were approved in doses of 2 tablets or capsules 4 times daily in combination with omeprazole (20 mg twice daily) or an H2 blocker for 10 or 14 days. Bismuth subsalicylate is also available without prescription, generically in tablets of 262 mg to combine with separate prescriptions for antibiotics and omeprazole to treat H. pylori or use as monotherapy for diarrhea and indigestion, given as 2 tablets every 30 to 60 minutes as needed but not to exceed 16 tablets in any 24 hours or to continue for more than 2 days. A popular nonprescription form of bismuth subsalicylate is &#x0201c;Pepto-Bismol&#x0201d; which is given in doses of 525 mg (30 mL) every 30 or 60 minutes until symptomatic resolution not to exceed 8 doses in one day or more than two days of therapy. Bismuth subsalicylate is rapidly disassociated in the stomach allowing salicylate to be absorbed, while bismuth is minimally absorbed. Bismuth is generally well tolerated, its major side effects being darkening of the stool and greyish discoloration of the tongue and teeth.</p>
          <p>Bismuth toxicity has been described but is now rare. It typically presents with neurologic symptoms including change in personality, abnormal behavior, muscle twitching, myoclonal jerks, ataxia, confusion, somnolence, and stupor. Such patients have typically been taking oral tablets or solution of bismuth intermittently for months if not years, but with high doses and when given parenterally, the onset can be within days of starting bismuth. The diagnosis can be suspected based upon the neurologic symptoms and the physical finding of discoloration of the tongue and teeth. Plasma bismuth levels are high (typically above 50 &#x003bc;g/L with normal levels being less than 5 &#x003bc;g/L). After stopping bismuth, plasma levels decrease gradually accompanied by resolution of symptoms. Most patients return to baseline levels of function but in severe cases, there can be residual neurologic deficits. Excessive bismuth subsalicylate can also cause salicylism with tinnitus and weakness, but bismuth therapy is usually recommended for short periods only.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Bismuth.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In large, controlled trials of bismuth-based quadruple therapy in patients with H. pylori infection, adverse event rates were similar in patients receiving therapy that included bismuth as those on triple H. pylori regimens without bismuth. Monotherapy with bismuth for digestive complaints and diarrhea has not been linked to significant adverse events or elevations in serum ALT or bilirubin, but few studies have assessed liver tests routinely during the brief use of bismuth for episodes of diarrhea or to prevent travelers diarrhea. Further, in the many case reports of bismuth neurotoxicity, there was no mention of hepatotoxicity, and where this information was provided, liver tests were reported to be normal.</p>
          <p>Despite the lack of evidence of liver injury in recent studies of bismuth therapy, several reports of both liver and kidney injury have been reported in the past which were attributed to bismuth. Most of these reports dealt with therapy of syphilis using injections of arsenicals and bismuth. Many of the cases were exposed to other possible hepatotoxins (arsenic), but all were reported from the 1920s and 1940s and may have been acute hepatitis B or C contracted because of inadequate sterilization of needles and syringes used in the injection therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
