          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Enasidenib is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 that is used in the therapy of selected cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Enasidenib is associated with a moderate rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and is suspected to cause rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Enasidenib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Enasidenib (en" a sid' e nib) is a small molecule inhibitor of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2), an enzyme rearranged and mutated in some forms of leukemia and lymphoma. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an oxidative decarboxylase which is important in maintaining normal progenitor and stem cell differentiation. Mutation in IDH can lead to accumulation of a toxic intermediate (2-hydroxyglutarate; 2-HG) that blocks normal cell differentiation and promotes cancer cell growth. IDH2 mutations are found in 8% to 20% of patients with AML. In cell culture, enasidenib decreased 2-HG levels and restored normal cell differentiation in cancer cells with IDH2 mutations. In several clinical trials enasidenib was found to induce objective responses in a high proportion of patients with refractory AML who harbored mutant IDH2. Enasidenib received accelerated approval for use in refractory or relapsed AML with susceptible IDH2 mutations in 2017. Enasidenib is available in tablets of 50 and 100 mg under the brand name IDHIFA. The recommended initial dose is 100 mg once daily, continued until progression in disease or intolerable toxicity occurs. Side effects are common and frequently severe (77%), leading to dose interruptions (43%), or discontinuations (17%). Common adverse events include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, and anorexia. Less common but potentially severe side effects include differentiation syndrome, tumor lysis syndrome, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Enasidenib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Elevations in serum aminotransferase levels are common during enasidenib therapy, occurring in over half of patients but rising above 5 times the ULN in only 1% to 2%. In addition, enasidenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 and is associated with increases in serum indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin in 83% of patients, which rise to levels of 5 to 10 mg/dL in 15% to 20% of subjects. These elevations are not accompanied by serum enzyme elevations and represent indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia without liver injury as occurs in patients with Gilbert syndrome. In pooled analysis of prelicensure clinical studies in 345 subjects, there were no cases of clinically apparent liver injury or deaths from liver disease. Since its approval and more widespread use, reports of hepatic failure have been reported in large series of enasidenib treated subjects, but documentation was not always adequate to assess whether the liver injury was related to therapy as opposed to a complication of the underlying leukemia or other treatment.</p>
          <p>In prelicensure studies, enasidenib therapy was associated with &#x0201c;differentiation syndrome&#x0201d; in 14% of patients which was sometimes severe and was fatal in at least two instances. Differentiation syndrome is marked by rapid proliferation of activated myeloid cells resulting in release of inflammatory cytokines and symptoms of respiratory distress, accompanied by hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, and pleural effusions. Other manifestations include renal impairment, fever, lymphadenopathy, rash, bone pain, peripheral edema, pericardial effusion, coagulopathy, and weight gain. Liver dysfunction can also occur but is generally overshadowed by the more severe systemic manifestations. The onset of differentiation syndrome is generally within 2 to 8 weeks of starting therapy and the course can be severe. Management includes stopping enasidenib and prompt use of corticosteroids in more severe cases. Patients can be restarted on enasidenib once the syndrome resolves.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible uncommon cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Enasidenib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of the liver injury due to enasidenib is not known. Enasidenib is metabolized in the liver largely by the cytochrome P450 system (largely CYP 3A4) and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with inhibitors or inducers of the microsomal enzyme system. Enasidenib is also metabolized by UGT1A1 and competes with bilirubin for conjugation accounting for the frequency of benign hyperbilirubinemia in treated patients. In some instances, serum aminotransferase elevations may arise due to the release of proinflammatory cytokines as a part of the differentiation syndrome.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Enasidenib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Enasidenib frequently causes mild-to-moderate transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels without symptoms or jaundice. Liver injury may also accompany acute differentiation syndrome induced by enasidenib, but therapy has not been linked convincingly to isolated, clinically apparent liver injury or acute liver failure. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) should lead to dose adjustment or temporary discontinuation, which should be permanent if laboratory values do not improve significantly or resolve within a few weeks or if symptoms or jaundice and direct hyperbilirubinemia arise.</p>
