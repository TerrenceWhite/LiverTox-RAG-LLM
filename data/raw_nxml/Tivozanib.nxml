          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tivozanib is a small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of relapsed or refractory renal cell carcinoma. Tivozanib is associated with transient and usually mild elevations in serum aminotransferase during therapy and but has not been linked instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tivozanib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tivozanib (tye voe&#x02019; za nib) is an orally available, small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor which is used as a third line treatment of relapsed or refractory renal cell carcinoma. Tivozanib inhibits multiple tyrosine kinases, including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, c-kit, and platelet derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR-&#x003b2;). These kinases are often overexpressed in cancer cells, and VEGFRs are frequently found in renal cell cancers. Tivozanib had growth inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo against renal cell cancer cell lines. In a randomized controlled trial in patients with relapsed or refractory renal cell cancer, tivozanib was found to be associated with a longer progression free survival than sorafenib. On the basis of these results, tivozanib was approved in the United States in 2021 as therapy of patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma following two or more prior therapies. Tivozanib is available in capsules of 1.34 and 0.89 mg under the brand name Fotivda. The recommended dose is 1.34 mg once daily for 21 days of 28-day cycles to continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Common side effects include hypertension, and symptoms of fatigue, diarrhea, decreased appetite, nausea, dysphonia, cough, and stomatitis. Therapy is also associated with hypothyroidism and decreases in serum sodium and phosphate. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include severe hypertension and hypertensive crisis, heart failure, arterial and venous thrombotic events, hemorrhage, proteinuria, thyroid dysfunction, impaired wound healing, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tivozanib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the published preregistration clinical trials of tivozanib, rates of serum ALT or AST elevations ranged from 10% to 29%, with 1% to 4% of treated patients having elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Instances of clinically apparent liver injury including deaths with hepatic failure were reported in some clinical trials, but in all cases were attributed to hepatic metastases or to other underlying liver diseases. Since its approval and more widespread clinical use, there have been no reports of clinically apparent liver injury or hepatic failure attributed to tivozanib, but it has had limited clinical use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tivozanib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Tivozanib therapy has been clearly linked to serum enzyme elevations the cause of which is unknown, but similar rates and patterns of liver test abnormalities have been reported with many kinase inhibitors and particularly with multi-kinase inhibitors such as tivozanib. Tivozanib is metabolized in the liver largely by CYP 3A and liver injury may be due to metabolism to an immunogenic or toxic intermediate. Tivozanib is also susceptible to drug-drug interactions with inducers or inhibitors of CYP 3A4.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tivozanib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Tivozanib has been clearly linked to serum aminotransferase elevations but has not been clearly linked to clinically apparent liver injury. The product label for tivozanib does not recommend routine monitoring of liver tests. But if found, serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times ULN should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation until the elevations are shown to have another cause or decrease into the normal or near normal range. ALT or AST elevations above 20 times ULN or any elevations accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should lead to discontinuation. There does not appear to be cross reactivity in risk for hepatic injury among the various kinase inhibitors but few instances have been studied.</p>
