          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Cabotegravir is an antiviral agent that inhibits the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) integrase and is used in combination with rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcription inhibitor, in the treatment of HIV infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The fixed combination of cabotegravir and rilpivirine is typically given intramuscularly once monthly and has been linked to a low rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and to rare episodes of acute, clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cabotegravir.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cabotegravir (ka&#x0201d; boe teg&#x02019; ra vir) is an antiretroviral drug that targets the HIV integrase, one of the three critical viral enzymes involved in HIV replication. Cabotegravir binds to the catalytic site of the HIV integrase, preventing the strand transfer activity and integration of the provirus into the host genome. Cabotegravir has both in vitro and in vivo activity against HIV and was developed as both oral and parenterally administered forms. In several randomized controlled trials, injections of a long acting formulation of cabotegravir in a fixed combination with a long acting rilpivirine, a non-nucleoside HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor, at 4 or 8 week intervals was found to effectively replace stable, effective daily oral regimens for HIV infection. Cabotegravir was approved as therapy of HIV infection in the United States in 2021, but only in combination with rilpivirine in both tablet (oral) forms as a 4 week lead-in therapy to parenteral therapy with solutions of long acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine given by intramuscular injections every 4 or 8 weeks for long term maintenance therapy. The fixed combination of cabotegravir and rilpivirine was initially indicated only for patients with HIV infection on an oral antiviral regimen that effectively suppressed viral levels to less than 50 copies/mL. The oral forms of cabotegravir and rilpivirine were approved only as lead-in to starting the monthly parenteral administration (or as temporary therapy of patients who miss a monthly injection). The long acting formulation of cabotegravir was approved for use as monotherapy in 2022 as a means of preventing HIV infection in high risk individuals. Cabotegravir is available in tablets of 30 mg under the brand name Vocabria to be used in combination with rilpivirine in tablets of 25 mg for one month before initiating parenteral injections. Cabotegravir and rilpivirine are also available in solution for intramuscular injection as a fixed combination of 400 and 600 mg for every 4 week administration and 600 and 900 mg for every 8 week administration under the brand name Cabenuva. Clinical trials have more recently shown that the combination of cabotegravir and rilpivirine can be used as an initial means of treating HIV infection without an oral lead-in phase. Finally, the long acting formulation of cabotegravir in solution is available separately for prevention of HIV infection in high risk individuals under the brand name Apretude. Common side effects of cabotegravir include headache, nausea, insomnia, vivid dreams, and anxiety, as well as injection site reactions with parenteral regimens. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions (fever, rash, angioedema, conjunctivitis, blisters and oral ulcers, DRESS syndrome), hepatotoxicity, and depression.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cabotegravir.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In large clinical trials, switching antiretroviral therapy of HIV infection to the combination of parenteral injections of long acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine was associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in up to 7% of patients, but levels above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) arose in only 1% to 2% of subjects. The elevations were typically transient, asymptomatic, and rarely required dose modification or discontinuation. While clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice was reported to occur in early studies, there were no such cases in the large, preregistration trials of long acting, parenteral cabotegravir and rilpivirine used for treatment of HIV infection or in the large trials of long acting cabotegravir used as prophylaxis against acquiring HIV infection. The use of injections every 4 or 8 weeks has been found to improve compliance and to be preferable to daily oral therapy by many patients requiring long term antiretroviral therapy. Since approval of cabotegravir for use as maintenance therapy and for prophylaxis against HIV infection, there have been no case reports of clinically apparent hepatotoxicity associated with its use.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, in the large preregistration trials of parenteral cabotegravir and rilpivirine as replacement therapy of HIV infection, cases of acute hepatitis A, B and C were reported as adverse events, occurring largely in patients who had been switched to the parenteral regimen compared to control subjects who were continued on oral agents. The reasons for these differences were unclear. Importantly, neither cabotegravir or rilpivirine have activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV), and one possibility has been that reactivation of hepatitis B may occur after withdrawal of oral antiretroviral agents that have activity against HBV, such as tenofovir, emtricitabine, and lamivudine. For this reason, patients starting long- acting parenteral regimens of cabotegravir and rilpivirine should be screened for hepatitis B virus markers and potential risks of stopping agents with activity against HBV should be considered. In addition, persons with HIV without protective antibodies to HAV and HBV should be offered hepatitis A and B virus vaccination.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>

        <sec id="Cabotegravir.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Cabotegravir is metabolized by the liver and undergoes glucuronidation as a part of its metabolic clearance. It does not have an effect on the CYP 450 system. Concomitant use of potent inducers of UGT1A can result in lower plasma levels which can predispose to virologic failure and development of antiviral resistance.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cabotegravir.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum enzyme elevations during combination therapy with cabotegravir and rilpivirine are not uncommon but are generally transient, mild-to-moderate in severity, and often attributable to other causes. Nevertheless, aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the ULN, if confirmed, warrant dose interruption and evaluation for other causes of acute liver injury. Because cabotegravir is usually given in combination with rilpivirine, it is difficult to attribute the injury to a single agent, and the combination generally needs to be discontinued if the injury is persistent or associated with symptoms or jaundice. HIV integrase inhibitors have rarely been implicated in causing hepatotoxicity and there is no information about the cross sensitivity to liver injury among the various HIV integrase inhibitors.</p>
