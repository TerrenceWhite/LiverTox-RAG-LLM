          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Ozanimod is an orally available immunomodulatory drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Ozanimod is associated with transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice, although experience with its use has been limited.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ozanimod.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ozanimod (oh zan&#x02019; i mod) is an immunomodulatory agent used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis that is believed to act by modulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Ozanimod is an analogue of sphingosine and is related in structure to fingolimod, the first S1P receptor inhibitor approved for use in multiple sclerosis. While fingolimod has nonspecific S1P receptor activity affecting receptor subtypes 1, 3, 4 and 5, siponimod, the second such analogue approved and ozanimod, the third, have a more limited specificity and primarily block S1P receptor 1 and 5 activity. The S1P receptor modulators, once phosphorylated intracellularly, render T and B cells insensitive to signals necessary for egress from lymphoid tissue. In animal models of multiple sclerosis, ozanimod resulted in reduced recirculation of autoaggressive lymphocytes to the central nervous system. Subsequently, in several large, randomized controlled trials, ozanimod was shown to reduce relapse rates and improve neuro-radiologic outcomes in adult patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Ozanimod was approved for use in the United States in 2020 as therapy of relapsing multiple sclerosis in adults. It is available in tablets of 0.23, 0.46 and 0.92 mg under the brand name Zeposia. As with other S1P receptor modulators, a short period of dose escalation is recommended for initiation of therapy with ozanimod. The recommended maintenance dose in adults is 0.92 mg orally once daily. Ozanimod has also been shown to have beneficial effects in ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, but has yet to be approved for these indications. Common side effects of ozanimod, as with other S1P receptor modulators, are lymphopenia, headache, diarrhea, cough, rhinorrhea and back and abdominal pain. Rare, but potentially severe adverse events include severe viral, bacterial or fungal infections, atrial arrhythmias and bradycardia, macular edema, decrease in pulmonary function, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and embryonal-fetal toxicity. Patients on long term ozanimod therapy should be monitored for infectious complications as well as for cardiac, pulmonary and ophthalmologic status.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ozanimod.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In large controlled trials of ozanimod in patients with multiple sclerosis, serum ALT elevations were common (~5% of recipients) but were typically mild and asymptomatic, and they returned to baseline values within a few months of stopping and often even with continuation of therapy. Aminotransferase elevations above 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 4% of ozanimod recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo recipients and elevations above 5 times ULN in 1%. In these prelicensure clinical trials, there were no cases of acute hepatitis or clinically apparent liver injury but elevations in liver tests led to discontinuation in approximately 1% of subjects. While ozanimod is associated with lymphopenia and long term therapy is associated with risk for reactivation of herpes simplex and zoster infections, it has not been linked to cases of reactivation of hepatitis B although one such instance has been reported with fingolimod. Thus, mild-to-moderate and transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy are not uncommon, but clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice due to ozanimod has not been reported, although the clinical experience with its use has been limited.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (suspected but unproven cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ozanimod.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which ozanimod might cause liver injury is not known. It is extensively metabolized by liver via the cytochrome P450 system, predominantly CYP 2C9 and 3A4 and drug-drug interactions with agents that induce or inhibit these enzymes are likely to occur. Serum enzyme elevations have been frequent with all of the oral S1P receptor modulators, particularly with fingolimod.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ozanimod.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>While chronic therapy with ozanimod can be associated with mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations, it has not been linked to any cases of clinically apparent liver injury. Because of the frequency of enzyme elevations detected during therapy, the product label for ozanimod recommends obtaining baseline liver tests before initiation of treatment. However, no specific recommendations for monitoring liver tests during treatment have been made. Any ALT or AST elevation associated with symptoms or jaundice should lead to prompt discontinuation of ozanimod. Patients with persistent elevations above 3 times ULN should be assessed for other causes of liver injury and discontinue ozanimod if not other cause is found. There is no known cross sensitivity of the hepatic injury from ozanimod with other agents used to treat multiple sclerosis. Because of the similarity in chemical structure and mechanism of action, there may be cross sensitivity to side effects with fingolimod, siponimod and ponesimod.</p>
