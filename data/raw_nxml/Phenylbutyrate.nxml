          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate are orphan drugs approved for the treatment of hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle disorders, a series of at least 8 rare genetic enzyme deficiencies. The urea cycle is the major pathway of elimination of excess nitrogen including ammonia, and absence of one of the urea cycle enzymes often causes elevations in serum ammonia which can be severe, life-threatening and result in permanent neurologic damage and cognitive deficiencies. Both phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate act by promoting an alternative pathway of nitrogen elimination. Neither phenylbutyrate nor sodium benzoate have been linked to cases of liver injury either in the form of serum enzyme elevations during therapy or clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>

            <title>Background</title>
            <p>Phenylbutyrate (fen" il beu' ti rate) is a prodrug that is metabolized to phenylacetate, which is the active molecule that combines with glutamine (an amino acid with two nitrogen molecules) to form phenylacetylglutamine, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys and does not require metabolism via the urea cycle. Phenylbutyrate thus provides an &#x0201c;ammonia sink&#x0201d;, an alternative pathway for excretion of excess nitrogen and ammonia. The active metabolite phenylacetate is also effective therapeutically, but has a disagreeable odor and taste that affect compliance and acceptability. Phenylbutyrate is odorless but does have a bitter, salty taste and is better tolerated than phenylacetate, but still not well accepted, particularly because it must be given in high doses, often as 3 to 12 tablets three times daily. Nevertheless, phenylbutyrate has been found to be effective in lowering ammonia levels in newborns, children and adults with acute hyperammonemic crises as well as to maintain normal or near normal levels of ammonia in patients between episodes (sometimes brought on by infection or excess dietary protein). Sodium phenylbutyrate received orphan drug approval for this indication in 1996. It is available in tablets of 500 mg and as a powder for oral solution under the brand name Buphenyl. The typical dose varies by body weight or surface area, but is in general in the range of 5 to 20 grams daily given in three equally divided doses with meals. Phenylbutyrate is administered in conjunction with a low protein diet, often combined with sodium benzoate (another ammonia &#x0201c;sink&#x0201d;) and essential amino acids (such as citrulline or arginine). However, the regimen used must be individualized based upon the type of urea cycle disorder and specific clinical features. Phenylbutyrate should be administered only by physicians with expertise in managing urea cycle disorders and with proper diagnostic evaluation and monitoring. Common effects of sodium phenylbutyrate are bitter taste, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and edema. Rare side effects include fever and rash. Because of the need to calculate dosages, overdosing can easily occur. Accidental use of higher than appropriate doses of phenylbutyrate can result in severe metabolic side effects and death.</p>
            <p>The poor acceptance of standard, sodium phenylbutyrate because of its bitter taste, high sodium content and pill burden (as many as 40 tablets daily) was a major impetus to the development of the glycerol-tri-phenylbutyrate, a formulation that is both tasteless and odorless, has a low sodium content and can be given orally as a liquid in a small volume. Glycerol phenylbutyrate was approved for treatment of hyperammonemia due to urea cycle disorders in 2013 and is available as an oral solution (1.1 g/mL) under the brand name Ravicti. The typical dose is 5 to 12 g/m<sup>2</sup> daily (~5-10 mL) in three divided doses with meals. The common side effects of sodium phenylbutyrate such as bitter taste, anorexia, nausea and vomiting are less with glycerol phenylbutyrate and the high sodium intake of the standard formulation can be avoided. Nevertheless, care in calculation of the dose is critical, and monitoring of ammonia and drug levels during treatment is recommended.</p>

          <sec id="Phenylbutyrate.Hepatotoxicity">
            <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
            <p>While the urea cycle disorders are caused by deficiencies of hepatic enzymes responsible for the elimination of nitrogen, patients generally present with hyperammonemia without other features or biochemical evidence of hepatic injury. Thus, serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels are generally normal or only mildly elevated. Newborns presenting with hyperammonemia may have hepatomegaly but other, non-urea cycle, liver function is normal as is hepatic histology. Phenylbutyrate can help to lower ammonia levels acutely and manage to keep them in the normal or near normal range, but generally does not affect other liver functions. In open label studies, a small proportion of patients (particularly with ornithine transcarbamylase [OTC] deficiency) have had ALT or AST elevations, but these have generally been attributed to the underlying condition or its complications. Phenylbutyrate has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>
            <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury, but experience with its use is limited).</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Sodium benzoate was the first agent developed specifically for the therapy of hyperammonemia caused by urea cycle disorders. Like phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate acts as an ammonia sink, eliminating nitrogen by an alternative pathways independent of the urea cycle. Sodium benzoate has not been linked to significant serum enzyme elevations during therapy or to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
          </sec>
          <sec id="Phenylbutyrate.Background_1">
            <title>Background</title>
            <p>Sodium benzoate (ben' zoe ate) is a small molecule that conjugates with glycine (an amino acid with one nitrogen molecule) to form hippuric acid, which is rapidly excreted by the kidneys and does not require metabolism via the urea cycle. Sodium benzoate is an orphan drug that is approved for the treatment of hyperammonemia in patients with urea cycle disorders, a series of at least 8 rare genetic deficiencies of enzymes involved in the urea cycle and elimination of nitrogen waste. Sodium benzoate has been shown to result in a rapid decrease in serum ammonia levels in children and adults with urea cycle disorders. It is less effective than phenylbutyrate, perhaps because it conjugates to glycine which has a single nitrogen molecule as opposed to phenylbutyrate which conjugates to glutamate which possesses two nitrogens. Nevertheless, because sodium benzoate acts via a different amino acid than phenylbutyrate, the two drugs can be used in combination to treat refractory cases of hyperammonemia due to urea cycle disorders. Indeed, the combination of sodium benzoate with phenylbutyrate was approved for use in the United States in 1996 for the treatment of hyperammonemic crises in children and adults with urea cycle disorders. The combination of sodium benzoate and phenylacetate is available as a solution for injection in single dose vials (50 mL: 50 mg of each) generically and under the brand name Ammonul. Oral formulations of sodium benzoate are available in other countries of the world. The intravenous preparation is used only to treat hyperammonemic crises with encephalopathy and the dose varies by type of urea cycle disorder and body weight. The intravenous combination of sodium benzoate and phenyl-acetate or -butyrate should be administered only by a physician with expertise in the management of urea cycle disorders. The intravenous infusion should be given via a central and not peripheral line. Common effects of sodium benzoate are nausea, vomiting, injection site reactions, fever, and rash. Because this product is given to patients with severe hyperammonemia who are often critically ill, many of the reported adverse events are more likely due to the underlying conditions rather than the sodium benzoate and phenylbutyrate; they include cardiac arrhythmias, hypoglycemia, respiratory distress and failure, seizures, coma, clonus, liver failure and hyperammonemia.</p>
