          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Artesunate for injection is an antimalarial drug used as the initial treatment of severe malaria in both adults and children. Typically, infusions of artesunate are continued for 2 to 7 days until the patient can tolerate oral antimalarial therapy. Artesunate therapy is associated with mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy but has not been linked instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Artesunate.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Artesunate (ar tes&#x02019; sun ate) is an intravenously administered antimalarial agent that is used in the initiation of treatment for severe malaria and is continued until the patient can tolerate an appropriate effective oral antimalarial therapy. Artesunate is rapidly metabolized to its active ingredient, dihydroartemisinin (DHA), which induces oxidative stress and inhibits protein and nucleic acid synthesis in plasmodium species that cause malaria. Artesunate has been shown to decrease in-hospital mortality of severe malaria by at least 40% and was approved for this indication in the United States in 2020. Artesunate is available in powdered form in single use vials of 110 mg for reconstitution under the name Artesunate. The recommended dose regimen is 2.4 mg per kg body weight intravenously at 0, 12, and 24 hours followed by once daily until oral therapy can be initiated. Artesunate treatment should be followed by an appropriate oral regimen for malaria. In prelicensure trials, serious adverse events included acute renal failure (9%), hemolysis (7%), and jaundice (2.3%). Artesunate can also cause hypersensitivity reactions including rash, urticaria, anaphylaxis, and Stevens Johnson syndrome. Artesunate given intravenously caused fetal harm in rats, but it is recommended to be given in pregnant women because of the greater harm to mother and child of inadequately treated, severe malaria.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Artesunate.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In an open label study of severe malaria in 104 patients in the United States, elevations in ALT occurred in 27% of subjects, AST in 49%, and bilirubin in 17%. These abnormalities, however, were attributable to the hemolysis and liver involvement that are common in patients with acute, severe malaria. None of the elevations were attributed to drug induced liver injury. Since licensure of artesunate for injection and its more widescale clinical use in the United States, there have been no reports of acute liver injury attributed to its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Artesunate.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The causes of liver test abnormalities during artesunate therapy of malaria are not known and are more likely due to the underlying severe infection rather than the infused drug. Artesunate can cause hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens Johnson syndrome, and liver injury might be a part of the immunoallergic reaction.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Artesunate.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for artesunate does not recommend monitoring of routine liver tests during therapy and the duration of treatment is usually brief, so that there is generally no chance to respond to occurrence of liver abnormalities and jaundice, which are frequent manifestations of acute severe malaria and resolve rapidly with successful therapy.</p>
