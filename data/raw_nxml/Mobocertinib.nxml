          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Mobocertinib is an oral tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor that targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and was given accelerated approved for use in refractory, advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations in 2021, but was subsequently withdrawn from use in October 2023 because of lack of efficacy found in a subsequent phase 3 controlled trial. Serum aminotransferase elevations occurred in 20% of patients treated with mobocertinib, but no episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice have been reported with its use.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Mobocertinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Mobocertinib (moe&#x0201d; boe cer&#x02019; ti nib) is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets both wild type and mutant forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which are found in patients with highly treated, resistant forms of advanced or metastatic cancer such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Mobocertinib has potent specificity against exon 20 insertion mutations of EGFR and its use is generally limited to NSCLC with these highly resistant mutants after therapy with first- or second-line therapies for NSCLC such as platinum based regimens and other EGFR inhibitors. Mobocertinib was granted accelerated approval in the United States in 2021 for adults with refractory, advanced or metastatic NSCLC with documented EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, the first oral drug to be approved for this indication. Mobocertinib became available in capsules of 40 mg under the brand name Exkivity. The recommended starting dose was 160 mg orally once daily to be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Mobocertinib was voluntarily withdrawn from use by the sponsor after initial results from a phase 3 clinical trial failed to show a significant effect on progression-free survival. Side effects were common during mobocertinib therapy, requiring dose interruptions in half of treated patients, dose reductions in 25%, and permanent discontinuation in 17%. Common adverse events included diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, fatigue, pruritis, rash, paronychia, musculoskeletal pains, and stomatitis. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events included prolongation of the QTc interval, interstitial lung disease, cardiac toxicity, severe diarrhea, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Mobocertinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of mobocertinib in patients with NSCLC harboring the exon 20 insertion mutation in EGRF, ALT elevations arose in 22% of patients but were usually self-limited and mild. ALT elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were uncommon, being found in 2% to 3% of treated patients. In the open label trials supporting the approval of mobocertinib, there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury, hepatic failure, or deaths from liver injury. Since the accelerated approval of mobocertinib in 2021 there were no published case reports of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Mobocertinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from mobocertinib is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities suggests some degree of direct toxicity. Mobocertinib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce the CYP enzyme reactivity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Mobocertinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for mobocertinib does not recommend regular monitoring of liver tests, but if serum aminotransferase levels above 5 times the ULN are identified, therapy should be held until levels fall into the normal or near normal range, at which point therapy can be resumed at the same or a reduced dose as clinically indicated and with continued monitoring. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the antineoplastic small molecule enzyme and receptor inhibitors, but there is no information on shared adverse event sensitivity of mobocertinib with other antineoplastic tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitors.</p>
