          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a humanized monoclonal antibody-cytotoxin conjugate which is used in the therapy of refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Inotuzumab ozogamicin has been linked to frequent serum enzyme elevations during therapy and with instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury, including acute sinusoidal obstruction syndrome which can be severe and even fatal.</p>

        <sec id="InotuzumabOzogamicin.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Inotuzumab (in" oh tooz' ue mab) ozogamicin (oh" zoe ga mye' sin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody conjugate that is used in the therapy of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The monoclonal antibody is to the human CD22 cell surface marker which is highly expressed on malignant lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The monoclonal antibody is conjugated to a cytotoxic agent from a class of calicheamicins called ozogamicin. When inotuzumab binds to CD22, it is internalized and the ozogamicin is released by the action of lysosomal enzymes on the linker molecule that joins it to the monoclonal antibody. The released intracellular ozogamicin causes breaks in double stranded DNA that leads to apoptotic cell death. This monoclonal antibody conjugate has been shown to be effective in inducing remissions in relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and was given accelerated approval for this indication in the United States in 2017. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is available as 0.9 mg of lyophilized powder in single dose vials for reconstitution under the brand name Besponsa. The recommended dose regimen varies by body weight, day of therapy and whether treating refractory vs relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is given intravenously typically on days 1, 8 and 15 of 21- or 28-day cycles. Premedication with a corticosteroid, antipyretic, and antihistamine is recommended before each dose. Common side effects include bone marrow suppression, infections, fatigue, fever, nausea, headache, abdominal pain and hemorrhage. Less common but potentially serious side effects include severe myelosuppression, severe infections, clinically significant bleeding and hemorrhage, infusion related reactions including anaphylaxis, QTc interval prolongation, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Inotuzumab ozogamicin should be prescribed and administered only by health care workers with expertise and experience in cancer chemotherapy and management of its adverse events.</p>

        <sec id="InotuzumabOzogamicin.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In prelicensure clinical trials of inotuzumab ozogamicin, up to half of patients had serum ALT or AST elevations during therapy which were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 2% to 5%. Hyperbilirubinemia was also common during inotuzumab therapy, generally occurring without accompanying ALT or AST elevations. More importantly, a variable proportion of patients (ranging from 2% to 35%) developed clinically apparent sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) after inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy. The proportion was even higher (15% to 25%) in patients who receive inotuzumab ozogamicin and subsequently underwent hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Symptoms of nausea, right upper quadrant pain, weight gain and abdominal distension (from ascites) arose within 5 to 20 days of the infusion and were followed in some patients by progressive rises in bilirubin, serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels. Clinically apparent SOS has a poor prognosis and the mortality rate is as high as 70%, most patients dying of multiorgan failure. Risk factors for developing SOS after inotuzumab therapy include allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation, use of other antineoplastic agents, and presence of preexisting liver disease. While SOS is the usual cause of clinically apparent liver injury attributable to inotuzumab, cases of cholestatic hepatitis without evidence of sinusoidal cell injury have been described in up to 8% of treated subjects. The clinical features of this injury have not been well characterized. Patients being treated with inotuzumab ozogamicin are often receiving multiple medications and have other reasons for having acute liver injury (sepsis, shock, graft-vs-host disease, or hepatic metastases).</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: A (well known cause of clinically apparent liver injury, generally due to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="InotuzumabOzogamicin.Mechanism_of_Liver">
          <title>Mechanism of Liver Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of the serum enzyme elevations during inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy is not known, but they are likely due to direct toxicity of the conjugate. The propensity of inotuzumab ozogamicin to cause sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is perhaps due to the fact that the antibody conjugate may be taken up by these cells resulting in their damage and release of cellular apoptotic fragments into sinusoids causing obstruction.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="InotuzumabOzogamicin.Outcome_and_Managem">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations that occur during inotuzumab ozogamicin therapy are generally transient and asymptomatic and do not require dose modification or delay in therapy. Elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal should lead to more careful monitoring and suspension of further infusions, at least until levels return to normal or near normal levels. The product label for inotuzumab ozogamicin has a black boxed warning for the risk of severe sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and recommends monitoring routine liver tests before administering each dose of the antibody-drug conjugate. Management of SOS generally rests on careful attention to fluid balance and treatment of complications. There are no proven means of prevention or treatment of SOS due to inotuzumab ozogamicin, although pretreatment with ursodiol and acute management with defibrotide are often employed. The adverse events profile and hepatotoxicity of inotuzumab ozogamicin are similar to those caused by gemtuzumab ozogamicin, a similar monoclonal antibody-conjugate directed to CD33 that is used to treat refractory or relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.</p>
