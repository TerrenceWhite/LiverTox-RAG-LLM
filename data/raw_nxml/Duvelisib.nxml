          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Duvelisib is an oral inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) that is approved for use in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Duvelisib is associated with a high rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy and with occasional concurrent rise in serum bilirubin and is a suspected but not proven cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Duvelisib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Duvelisib (doo" ve lis' ib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the delta and gamma isoforms of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K &#x003b4;/&#x003bb;), which is an essential component in the B cell signaling pathways that drive migration of B cells to lymph nodes and bone marrow. Inhibition of this pathway inhibits B cell chemotaxis and adherence and reduces cell viability. This pathway is upregulated in many B cell malignancies and has been shown to be critical for proliferation and survival of leukemia and lymphomatous malignant B lymphocytes. Duvelisib was approved for use in the United States in 2018 as therapy for relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) as well as refractory forms of follicular lymphoma (an indication that was subsequently withdrawn). Duvelisib is available as capsules of 15 and 25 mg under the brand name Copiktra. The recommended dose is 25 orally mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects are common but most often mild-to-moderate in severity, and include diarrhea, neutropenia, rash, fatigue, fever, cough, musculoskeletal pain and anemia. Common laboratory abnormalities can include cytopenias, liver enzyme elevations, hyper- or hypo-glycemia, and hyponatremia. Severe adverse events (for which it has a black box warning) can include severe diarrhea or colitis, pneumonitis, intestinal perforation, severe skin rash, anaphylaxis, neutropenia and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Duvelisib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In clinical trials of duvelisib in patients with CLL and lymphoma, the rates of serum enzyme elevations during therapy ranged from 39% to 57% and were above 5 times the ULN in 3% to 8%. Serum enzyme elevations typically arose within 4 to 12 weeks of starting therapy and usually resolved rapidly with dose reduction or temporary discontinuation. In many instances, the serum aminotransferase elevations resolved spontaneously and most (but not all) patients were able to restart duvelisib without recurrence. While there were no reported cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice, up to 35% of patients discontinued duvelisib because of serum enzyme elevations and all patients were followed carefully during treatment. In one study, 2% of treated patients developed concurrent elevations in serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels but there were no episodes considered to be clinically apparent liver injury and no deaths due to liver failure. Duvelisib has not been widely used since its approval, and its potential for causing acute clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice has not been well defined. Because duvelisib affects B cell function, it may also be capable of inducing reactivation of hepatitis B, although in published trials of the agent, reactivation was not reported.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproved but suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Duvelisib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The reason why duvelisib causes serum enzyme elevations is not known, but may be a direct toxicity to hepatocytes caused by inhibition of PI3K activity or the result of change in B cell activity and caused by induction of immune mediated liver injury as has been reported with other small molecule PI3K inhibitors such as idelalisib. Duvelisib is metabolized primarily in the liver by cytochrome P450 (CYP 3A4) and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP 3A4 and itself may inhibit CYP 3A4 activity and affect plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by this microsomal enzyme.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Duvelisib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum enzyme elevations are not uncommon during cancer chemotherapy with duvelisib and may occasionally be dose limiting. Duvelisib should not be used with other agents with hepatotoxic potential. Furthermore, regular monitoring of liver tests is recommended during duvelisib therapy, with more frequent monitoring if serum aminotransferase values rise. Duvelisib should be held if ALT or AST values rise above 5 times the ULN, and treatment resumed only if values fall below 3 times ULN and then with careful monitoring or at a reduced dose. Elevations of aminotransferase values of more than 20 times the ULN, or appearance of jaundice or symptoms should trigger permanent discontinuation. Corticosteroids are often used if the liver injury does not resolve rapidly with stopping duvelisib and continuing the corticosteroids may help prevent recurrence of injury with restarting therapy. There is no known cross sensitivity to hepatic injury among the different protein kinase inhibitors.</p>
