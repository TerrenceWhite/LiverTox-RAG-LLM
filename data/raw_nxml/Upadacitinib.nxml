          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Upadacitinib is an oral selective inhibitor of Janus associated kinase 1 (JAK-1) that is used in the therapy of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Upadacitinib has been associated with a low rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury although it may pose a risk for reactivation of hepatitis B in susceptible patients.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Upadacitinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Upadacitinib (ue pad&#x0201d; a sye&#x02019; ti nib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of Janus associated kinase (JAK), which is an essential component in the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway of immune activation and cytokine release. Inhibition of this pathway decreases T cell activation and proinflammatory cytokine release. Upadacitinib has a relative selectivity for JAK-1 and has been shown to improve symptoms and signs of active rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, atopic dermatitis and ulcerative colitis. Upadacitinib was approved for use in 2019 in the United States as therapy for moderate or severely active rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed to respond or are intolerant of conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers. Since that time, the indications for upadacitinib have been expanded to include psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis. The indications are generally limited to patients with moderately to severely active disease who have failed or were intolerant to therapy with systemic treatments such as TNF blockers. Upadacitinib is available in extended release tablets of 15, 30 and 45 mg under the brand name Rinvoq. The recommended maintenance dose is 15 mg once daily. Combination with other DMARDs or biologic agents is not recommended. Recommendations are limited to adults, except for atopic dermatitis (children 12 years or older). The regimen for ulcerative colitis includes an induction phase of 45 mg once daily for 8 weeks. Common side effects include mild-to-moderate symptoms of upper respiratory infection, cough, fever, fatigue, nausea, and laboratory abnormalities of lipids, liver and muscle enzymes. Uncommon, but potentially serious side effects include serious and opportunistic infections, reactivation of latent tuberculosis, herpes zoster, venous thromboses, gastrointestinal perforation, malignancy, major cardiovascular adverse events and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Upadacitinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of upadacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, liver test abnormalities were frequent although usually mild. Some degree of ALT elevation arose in up to 11% of upadacitinib treated patients compared to 7% treated with placebo, but were above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 2% or less. Furthermore, similar rates of ALT elevations arose in patients treated with methotrexate or biologic DMARDs. In these trials that enrolled over 3000 patients, there were no reports of clinically apparent liver injury, serious cases of liver injury or liver-related deaths. Similarly, other JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib and baricitinib have been associated with frequent minor serum aminotransferase elevations during treatment, but episodes of clinically apparent liver injury have not been reported. Thus, this class of agents is suspected but not proven capable of causing liver injury.</p>
          <p>In addition, long term treatment with upadacitinib and other Janus kinase inhibitors has been linked to rare instances of reactivation of hepatitis B that can be severe and has been linked to fatal outcomes. Reactivation can become clinically apparent after the JAK inhibitor is discontinued, when immune restoration results in an immunologic response to the heightened viral replication.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible, rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury including reactivation of hepatitis B in susceptible patients).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Upadacitinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of liver injury from upadacitinib is unknown, but with pattern of abnormalities suggests some degree of low level, direct hepatotoxicity. Thus, mean ALT levels rise slightly during the first 4 to 8 weeks of therapy (by approximately 5 U/L and usually remaining within the normal range) and return to baseline rapidly with stopping. In instances of more marked elevations, the abnormalities also resolve rapidly with discontinuation and may not recur with reexposure. Upadacitinib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4 (and by CYP 2D6 to a lesser extent) and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce the CYP enzyme reactivity.</p>
          <p>Reactivation of hepatitis B from JAK inhibitors, in contrast, is likely due to indirect effects of upadacitinib in causing immune suppression which may to lead to increased HBV replication which if followed by immune recovery, can result in acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Upadacitinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation. In patients with clinically apparent liver injury and jaundice, restarting therapy should be done with caution. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the tyrosine kinase inhibitors but there is no information or shared adverse event sensitivity among the small molecule JAK inhibitors. Tofacitinib and baricitinib have been linked to cases of reactivation of hepatitis B which can be severe. Importantly, patients who are to receive long term therapy with upadacitinib should be screened for hepatitis B (HBsAg and anti-HBc). Patients with HBsAg in serum should be treated prophylactically with an oral antiviral agent with activity against HBV such as entecavir or tenofovir. An alternative, which is applicable to those with anti-HBc without HBsAg, is to monitor patients carefully for HBV DNA levels to detect evidence of reactivation early and initiate appropriate therapy for HBV infection.</p>
