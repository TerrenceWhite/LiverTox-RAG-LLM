          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Ripretinib is a multikinase inhibitor that is used to treat refractory forms of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Serum aminotransferase elevations occur in a small proportion of patients treated with ripretinib, but episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice have not been reported with its use.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ripretinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ripretinib (rip re&#x02019; tin ib) is an orally available multikinase inhibitor that targets the proto-oncogene KIT and platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) and is used to treat patients with advanced and refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) after failure of other therapies. GIST is a rare mesenchymal tumor found most commonly in the stomach and small intestine that varies greatly in aggressiveness from indolent to rapidly progressive. GIST often harbors mutant forms of oncogenes that drive cancer cell proliferation and spread, most commonly KIT (80%) and PDGFRA (5% to 10%). Inhibition of these oncogene receptors can result in marked regression in tumor size. Ripretinib has activity against several other kinases such as PDGFR beta, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1), TIE2 (angiopoietin receptor), and BRAF, some of which may play a role in the efficacy as well as adverse effects of ripretinib. The first line therapy of GIST is with imatinib which is highly effective, but limited by development of resistant mutations in KIT and other genes which then may require second and third line kinase inhibitors such as sunitinib, nilotinib, regorafenib, bosutinib, ponatinib, or avapritinib. Ripretinib was found to have activity in vitro and in vivo against GIST derived tumor cells with resistant mutations. Ripretinib therapy was subsequently shown to improve progression-free and overall survival in patients with advanced GIST who were refractory to or intolerant of standard kinase inhibitors. Ripretinib was approved in the United States in 2020 as therapy for adults with refractory advanced GIST who have failed therapy with at least 3 standard tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Ripretinib is available in tablets of 50 mg under the brand name Qinlock. The recommended regimen is 150 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects are common and can include alopecia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain, myelosuppression, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome). Potent severe adverse events include new onset cutaneous malignancies (including melanoma), photosensitivity, hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, impaired wound healing, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ripretinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with refractory and extensively treated GIST, ALT elevations arose in 13% of ripretinib- vs 5% of placebo-treated subjects. ALT elevations were generally transient and mild, and were above 5 times the ULN in only 1% of treated patients and did not require dose modification or discontinuation. Bilirubin elevations were reported in 22% of ripretinib treated patients but only 7.5% of placebo controls. The bilirubin elevations were transient and mild, but were not characterized as to their timing, severity and whether conjugated or unconjugated (direct or indirect). In the open label and controlled trials supporting the approval of ripretinib, there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury, hepatic failure, or deaths from liver injury. Since its approval in the United States and Europe, there have been no reported cases of clinically apparent liver injury associated with ripretinib therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ripretinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The possible cause of liver injury from ripretinib therapy is unknown. While serum bilirubin elevations occurred in more than 20% of patients in preregistration trials, the timing, duration and degree of elevations and whether conjugated or unconjugated were not described. Ripretinib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP3A4 and 2D9. Ripretinib is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce the CYP 3A4 activity and concurrent use of strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 should be avoided.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ripretinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for ripretinib does not recommend routine monitoring of liver laboratory tests during therapy. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if detected) should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation of treatment with careful monitoring if restarted after resolution of the abnormalities. Elevations of aminotransferase levels above 20 times ULN and any elevation accompanied by jaundice or symptoms of liver injury should trigger permanent discontinuation of therapy. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the antineoplastic kinase inhibitors, and in preregistration trials, shared liver injury sensitivity between ripretinib and previous administered antineoplastic kinase inhibitors was not found.</p>
