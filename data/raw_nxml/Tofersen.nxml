          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tofersen is an antisense oligonucleoside directed against mutated forms of SOD1 used in the treatment of adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with mutations in the SOD1 gene. Tofersen has been associated with minor liver test abnormalities during therapy but has not been linked instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tofersen.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tofersen (toe fer&#x02019; sin) is an antisense oligonucleoside that is directed against the mRNA of the mutated superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene and is used in the treatment of adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with mutated SOD1. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare, but invariably fatal neuromuscular disease characterized by progressive loss of motor neurons resulting in muscle weakness, atrophy, and eventual paralysis, leading to death from respiratory failure within 2 to 10 years of onset. Several genes have been associated with an increased risk of ALS including mutated SOD1 which is found in approximately 10% of patients. The mutated SOD1 protein appears to be toxic to motor neurons. Tofersen is an antisense oligonucleoside that is directed to mutated SOD1 and results in degradation of the mRNA and a decrease in mutated SOD1 protein production. In animal models, treatment with tofersen resulted in decreases in SOD1 levels in serum and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and slowed the progression of the neuromuscular disease. In the initial preregistration controlled trials, tofersen led to only modest improvements in progressive symptoms and signs of disease but did decrease serum and CSF SOD1 levels and improve surrogate markers of neurodegeneration (serum levels of neurofilament light chain: NfL). In longer term studies, tofersen was found to stabilize symptoms and body weight and to slow disease progression. Tofersen was approved for use in the United States in 2023 for adults with ALS and mutated SOD1 gene. It is available in solution as 100 mg in 15 mL in single use vials under the brand name Qalsody. The usual treatment regimen is 3 loading doses of 100 mg given intrathecally every 14 days, followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg given every 28 days. Side effects are common, mostly attributable to the lumbar puncture required for its administration. Common adverse events include pain, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia, and an increase in white blood cells in the CSF. Severe adverse events occur in up to 10% of patients including myelitis, radiculitis, papilledema, increased intracranial pressure, and aseptic meningitis.</p>

        <sec id="Tofersen.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the initial registration trial of tofersen in ALS, serum aminotransferase elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in 4% of treated patients, but the elevations were generally transient, mild, and no more frequent than in a placebo-treated patients (3%). With longer term, open label studies, ALT elevations above 3 times ULN arose in 11% of tofersen-treated subjects and were above 5 times ULN in 4%. However, the elevations were not accompanied by symptoms or jaundice, and there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury or discontinuations because of liver test abnormalities. Since its approval, clinical experience with tofersen has been limited, but there have been no published case reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tofersen.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which tofersen might cause liver injury is not clear. Tofersen is a short (20 mer) oligonucleotide and is metabolized to short sequences or individual nucleotides by tissue and plasma exonucleases. Tofersen is administered intrathecally, but low levels are found in serum. It is not metabolized by P450 enzymes, has no effect on their level of activity, and has not been linked to significant drug-drug interactions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tofersen.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase elevations that occur on tofersen therapy are unlikely to be due to the drug therapy and rarely require dose modification or discontinuation. Persistent ALT or AST elevations arising during therapy should lead to evaluation of their possible causes. There is no information on cross sensitivity to liver injury among the various other therapies for ALS.</p>
