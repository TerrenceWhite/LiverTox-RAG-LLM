          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Caplacizumab is a humanized single variable domain immunoglobulin (nanobody) against the von Willebrand factor, which is used to treat acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Caplacizumab increases the risk of minor and major bleeding episodes and is associated with a low rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy, but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Caplacizumab (cap&#x0201d; la siz&#x02019; ue mab) is a humanized single variable domain of immunoglobulin (nanobody) directed against the von Willebrand factor which has been developed as therapy of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Acquired TTP is a rare but severe and often fatal syndrome marked by appearance of thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and multiple microvascular thromboses, with kidney, heart and renal dysfunction due to the development of autoantibodies against ADAMTS13, a vWF cleaving metalloprotease that controls platelet aggregation by vWF. The deficiency in ADAMTS13 results in formation of large platelet-vWF aggregates that cause the pathologic thromboses. Therapy of aTTP generally involves emergency plasma exchange transfusions to reduce levels of the pathogenic autoantibody as well as immunosuppression (usually high doses of corticosteroids or rituximab) to decrease the autoantibody production. Caplacizumab binds to activated vWF and decreases thrombus formation allowing for increases in plasma ADAMTS13 activity. In several small randomized controlled trials, caplacizumab therapy was associated with elevations in serum ADAMTS13, a shorter time to clinical response (rise in platelet counts) and fewer complications, exacerbations and relapses of TTP. Caplacizumab was approved in the United States for use in combination with plasma exchange therapy in patients with acquired TTP in 2019. The recombinant &#x0201c;nanobody&#x0201d; is available in vials of 11 mg per mL under the brand name Cablivi. Administration of caplacizumab is timed with the plasma exchange procedures, generally given initially as an intravenous infusion of 11 mg before the first plasma exchange, followed by 11 mg subcutaneously at the conclusion of each plasma exchange; after the plasma exchange period, 11 mg subcutaneously once daily for 30 days. Common side effects include local infusion reactions, headaches and fatigue, but most characteristically bleeding episodes, typically epistaxis, bruising and gingival and rectal bleeding. Severe adverse events include serious bleeding episodes such as subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhage which can be fatal. Early recognition and prompt management of these side effects is an integral component of proper use of caplacizumab.</p>

        <sec id="Caplacizumab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations arise in 1% to 2% of treated patients, but are generally asymptomatic and transient and rarely necessitate discontinuation of caplacizumab injections. Serum ALT elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in less than 1% of patients in registration trials of caplacizumab but there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury. Since approval and more general use of caplacizumab, there have been no reports of clinically significant liver injury attributed to its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Caplacizumab.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The possible mechanisms of liver injury due to caplacizumab are unclear unless they might be caused by excessive bleeding. Monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulins are generally taken up by cells and metabolized to short peptides and amino acids.</p>
