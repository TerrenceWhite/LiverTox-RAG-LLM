          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Asciminib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that specifically targets myristoyl pocket of ABL1 and is used to treat refractory forms of Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myelocytic leukemia. Serum aminotransferase elevations occur in a proportion of patients treated with asciminib, but episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice have not been reported with its use.</p>

        <sec id="Asciminib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Asciminib (as kim&#x02019; in ib) is an orally available, tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the myristoyl pocket of ABL1 resulting in inhibition of the abnormal fusion kinase BCR-ABL1 that drives cellular proliferation in chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) associated with the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+). The Philadelphia chromosome is an acquired genetic abnormality of chromosome 22 found in leukemic cells, which is created by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes resulting in a fusion gene of ABL1 (for Abelson leukemia virus) from chromosome 9 and the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) of chromosome 22. The translocated gene creates a hybrid tyrosine kinase receptor that is continuously synthesized in an active form causing uncontrolled growth and proliferation of the affected cell. Referred to as a STAMP positive tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, asciminib specifically targets the ABL1 myristoyl pocket and has separate activity and resistance patterns compared to conventional anti-BCR-ABL1 kinases that target the catalytic site of the abnormal BCR-ABL1 kinase. Asciminib has potent specificity against the T315I mutant of ABL1 that is resistant to standard tyrosine kinase inhibitors used to treat CML, such as imatinib, sunitinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib, and regorafenib, the first-, second-, and third-line therapies of Ph+ CML. Asciminib was granted accelerated approval in the United States in 2021 for adults with refractory or relapsed CML after therapy with at least two conventional BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitors and in high doses for refractory cases harboring the T315I mutant. Asciminib is available in tablets of 20 and 40 mg under the brand name Scemblix. The recommended oral dose varies by indication, being 40 mg twice or 80 mg once daily for refractory cases of Ph+ CML, but 200 mg twice daily for cases harboring the highly resistant T315I mutation. Therapy should continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects are dose related, but at the highest dose are common, arising in almost all patients. Common side effects include anemia, neutropenia, myelosuppression, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, headache, rash, and diarrhea. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include severe myelosuppression, pancreatitis, hypertension, hypersensitivity reactions, cardiovascular toxicity, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>

        <sec id="Asciminib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of asciminib in patients with refractory and extensively treated CML, ALT elevations arose in 13% of patients but were usually self-limited and mild. ALT elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were uncommon, being found in 3% of treated patients. The ALT elevations were typically transient and rarely required dose interruption or modification. In the open label and controlled trials supporting the approval of asciminib, there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury, hepatic failure or deaths from liver injury. Furthermore, patients with aminotransferase elevations during therapy with first and second line BCR-ABL1 inhibitors did not have an increased rate of such elevations during asciminib therapy. Since its approval in the United States and Europe, there have been no reported cases of clinically apparent liver injury associated with asciminib therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Asciminib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from asciminib is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities suggests a mild degree of direct hepatotoxicity. Asciminib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4 and 2C9 and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce the CYP enzyme reactivity. Asciminib itself inhibits CYP 3A4 and P-glycoprotein and can result in increased levels of drugs that are substrates of these hepatic metabolizing and transport proteins.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Asciminib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for asciminib does not recommend routine monitoring of liver laboratory tests during therapy. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times ULN (if detected) should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation of treatment with careful monitoring if restarted after resolution of the abnormalities. Elevations of aminotransferase levels accompanied by jaundice or symptoms of liver injury should trigger permanent discontinuation of therapy. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the antineoplastic, small molecule enzyme and receptor inhibitors and in preregistration trials, shared liver injury sensitivity between asciminib and other antineoplastic BCR-ABL1 inhibitors was not found.</p>
