          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Belantamab mafodotin is a humanized monoclonal antibody conjugate that was given accelerated approval for therapy of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma in 2020 but was withdrawn in 2022 after failing to demonstrate a significant increase in survival compared to conventional therapies. Belantamab mafodotin has been linked to transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy and has been implicated in at least one case of fatal sinusoidal obstruction syndrome.</p>

        <sec id="Belantamab.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Belantamab (bel an&#x02019; ta mab) mafodotin (ma foe doe&#x02019; tin) is a humanized monoclonal antibody to the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) conjugated by a linker sequence to mafodotin, a direct cellular toxin. BCMA is a cell surface receptor that is highly expressed on multiple myeloma cells as well as normal plasma cells and some mature B lymphocytes. Mafodotin, also known as monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF), is a cytotoxic inhibitor of microtubule formation. The monoclonal antibody conjugate binds to and is taken up by BCMA-expressing malignant myeloma cells, and the microtubule inhibitor is released intracellularly by lysosomal protease hydrolysis of the linker sequence. The intracellular mafodotin inhibits microtubule formation causing cell cycle arrest resulting in apoptotic cell death of myeloma cells. This monoclonal antibody conjugate was shown to be effective in inducing remissions in adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Belantamab mafodotin was given accelerated approval in 2020 in the United States for treatment of adults with advanced multiple myeloma after failure of at least four prior therapies. Belantamab mafodotin became available as a powder for reconstitution in single dose vials of 100 mg under the brand name Blenrep. The typical recommended dose regimen was 2.5 mg/kg administered by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects were common and included ocular toxicity of keratopathy with decreased visual acuity and blurred vision, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, weakness, headache, fatigue, fever, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and increases in serum creatinine. Less common, but potentially serious side effects included severe infusion reactions, severe myelosuppression and thrombocytopenia, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Belantamab mafodotin should be administered only by physicians and health care providers with training and expertise in cancer chemotherapy and management of its potential adverse effects.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Belantamab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In publications of the registration trials of belantamab mafodotin, serum aminotransferase elevations arose in up to 57% of treated patients, but were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in only 2% to 3%, and no patient developed clinically apparent liver injury attributed to therapy. After its approval and more widespread use, a case of fatal sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was reported in an elderly man with extensively treated multiple myeloma after a 9<sup>th</sup> cycle of belantamab mafodotin. Belantamab mafodotin was withdrawn from availability in 2022 after an ongoing clinical trial found that it did not significantly prolong progression free survival compared to conventional chemotherapy regimens for advanced and refractory multiple myeloma.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible cause of clinically apparent liver injury most likely due to sinusoidal obstruction syndrome).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Belantamab.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The causes of the serum enzyme elevations and sinusoidal obstruction syndrome noted during belantamab mafodotin therapy are not known, but are likely due to direct toxicity of the mafodotin conjugate rather than the monoclonal antibody.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Belantamab.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase elevations that occurred during belantamab mafodotin therapy were generally transient, mild and asymptomatic, and rarely required dose modification or delay in therapy. The product label for belantamab mafodotin did not recommend routine monitoring of liver tests. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal, if detected, should lead to more careful monitoring and suspension of further infusions, at least until enzyme levels return to normal or near normal values. Elevations above 20 times the ULN or any elevation accompanied by jaundice or symptoms or any indications of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome should lead to prompt and permanent discontinuation.</p>
