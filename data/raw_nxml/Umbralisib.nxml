          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Umbralisib is an oral kinase inhibitor that is was given accelerated approved for use in adults with relapsed or refractory marginal zone and follicular lymphoma in 2021, but the approval was withdrawn a year later because of data from a trial showing excess mortality with its use. Umbralisib was associated with a modest rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy but was not reported to cause clinically apparent acute liver with symptoms or jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Umbralisib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Umbralisib (um" bra lis' ib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of multiple kinases that play a role in B cell malignant cellular pathways and that was used in the therapy of refractory cases of marginal zone and follicular lymphoma. The kinases inhibited by umbralisib include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3K&#x003b4;), which is an essential component in the B cell signaling pathways that drive migration of B cells to lymph nodes and bone marrow. This pathway is upregulated in many B cell malignancies and has been shown to be critical for proliferation and survival of leukemia and lymphomatous malignant B lymphocytes. Inhibition of this pathway inhibits B cell chemotaxis and adherence and reduces cell viability. Umbralisib also has activity against casein kinase epsilon which plays a role in protein synthesis and RNA translation and is altered in some malignancies. Other activities of umbralisib include inhibition of cell adhesion molecules and other kinases including BCR-ABL1. Studies in animal models and in early phase clinical trials showed that umbralisib had activity against several hematologic malignancies. Umbralisib was given tentative approval for use in the United States as therapy for refractory or relapsed marginal zone and follicular lymphoma after failure of one or more systemic therapies in February 2021. A little over a year later, FDA approval was withdrawn because of concerns about excess mortality in patients receiving Umbralisib in follow up clinical trials. The deaths on treatment were not liver related but the nature and relatedness of the mortality to umbralisib therapy was not well defined. Umbralisib was previously available in tablets of 200 mg under the brand name Ukoniq. The recommended dose was 800 mg once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects of umbralisib were common but usually mild-to-moderate in severity, and included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, headache, musculoskeletal pain, stomatitis, fever, pain, rash, and infections. Common laboratory abnormalities included cytopenias, liver enzyme elevations, hyper- or hypo-glycemia, and hyponatremia. Severe potential adverse events included neutropenia, severe infections, severe diarrhea, allergic and hypersensitivity reactions, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Because of excess mortality among umbralisib- in comparison to placebo-treated patients, FDA approval was withdrawn in June 2022 and the product was withdrawn by the sponsor.</p>

        <sec id="Umbralisib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In clinical trials of umbralisib in adults with lymphoma, the rates of serum enzyme elevations during therapy ranged from 15% to 35% and were above 5 times the ULN in 5% to 8% and occasionally above 20 times ULN (&#x0003c;1%). The aminotransferase elevations arose within 4 to 12 weeks of starting therapy in most instances and usually resolved without dose modification or temporary discontinuation. Nevertheless, there were no instances of serum enzyme elevations accompanied by jaundice and no liver related deaths.</p>
          <p>Because umbralisib affects B cell function, it may also be capable of inducing reactivation of hepatitis B, although in published trials of the agent, instances of HBV reactivation were not reported.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven, but suspected rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Umbralisib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The reason why umbralisib causes serum enzyme elevations is not known, but may be a direct toxicity to hepatocytes caused by inhibition of PI3K activity or the result of change in B cell activity and caused by induction of autoimmunity. Umbralisib is metabolized primarily by aldehyde oxidase which is present in many tissues, but highest concentrations are in the liver. The cytochrome P450 system plays a minor role in the metabolism (CYP 3A4) of umbralisib, but concentrations may be affected by drugs that induce or inhibit CYP 3A activity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Umbralisib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum enzyme elevations were not uncommon during chemotherapy with umbralisib and were often dose limiting. The product label recommended that umbralisib not be used with other agents with hepatotoxic potential. Furthermore, regular monitoring of liver tests every 2 to 4 weeks was recommended during the first six months of umbralisib therapy and every 1 to 3 months thereafter, with more frequent monitoring if serum aminotransferase values rise. It was recommended that umbralisib be held if ALT or AST values rise above 5 times ULN, and treatment resumed only if and when values fall into the normal range and then with a reduced dose and careful monitoring. Elevations of aminotransferase values of more than 20 times the ULN, or appearance of jaundice or symptoms of liver injury were considered to require permanent discontinuation. There was no known cross sensitivity to hepatic injury between umbralisib and other protein kinase inhibitors.</p>
