          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Deucravacitinib is a small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinase 2 that is used in the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Deucravacitinib is associated with transient and usually mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy but has not been linked instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Deucravacitinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Deucravacitinib (deu krav&#x0201d; a sye&#x02019; ti nib) is an orally available, small molecular inhibitor of tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) that is used to treat moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. TYK2 is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase and a member of the JAK kinase family, which are critical components of pathways that lead to production and secretion of hematologic growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. These pathways are important in hematologic cell differentiation and proliferation, intracellular signaling by interferon alpha and gamma, and in cytokine-production and inflammatory reactions. Inhibition of TYK2 leads to decreases in expression of IL23, type 1 interferon, and beta defensin. Patients with psoriasis frequently have raised levels of cytokines that are modulated by TYK2, such as IL23, IL17, and type 1 interferon, and which are decreased by deucravacitinib therapy. Deucravacitinib has been shown to improve symptoms and rash in patients with plaque psoriasis and was approved in the United States in 2023 for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic or phototherapy. Deucravacitinib is available in tablets of 6 mg under the brand name Sotyktu. The recommended dose is 6 mg once daily. Common side effects include symptoms of upper respiratory infection, mouth ulcers, folliculitis, acne, herpes simplex, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevations. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions, risk of infections including reactivation of tuberculosis, rhabdomyolysis, and malignancies. It is suspected that TYK2 inhibitors share the long term adverse events found with JAK inhibitors, which include increased risk of major cardiovascular adverse events, serious infections, venous and arterial thromboses, secondary malignancies, and overall mortality.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Deucravacitinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the preregistration clinical trials of deucravacitinib that included data on 1519 subjects, only 1.8% of patients had serum ALT or AST elevations above 5 times ULN, none of which were considered likely due to drug induced liver injury, with myositis accounting for many of the elevations, and underlying alcoholic or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease accounting for a few. Elevations of ALT levels above 3 times the ULN arose in 1.1% to 1.3% of recipients of deucravacitinib in a 24 week trial compared to 1.2% of placebo recipients. While there were no instances of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients receiving deucravacitinib, patients with preexisting HBsAg in serum were excluded from enrollment and most treatment courses were limited in duration. Since its approval and more widespread clinical use, there have been no further reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to deucravacitinib, but it has been available for a limited time only.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (suspected but unproven cause of clinically apparent liver injury including reactivation of hepatitis B).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Deucravacitinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Deucravacitinib therapy is associated with only a low rate of serum enzyme elevations and the mechanisms by which it might cause liver injury are unknown. It is metabolized in the liver largely by CYP 1A2 and to a lesser extent by CYP 2B6, 2D6, carboxylesterase 2, and uridine glucuronyl transferase. However, deucravacitinib neither induces nor inhibits these metabolizing enzymes, and it has not been found to have clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Because of its effects on intracellular signaling involved in immune responses, deucravacitinib (and other JAK inhibitors) may be capable of increasing hepatitis B viral replication which might result in clinically apparent reactivation of hepatitis B.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Deucravacitinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Deucravacitinib has been associated with a low rate of serum aminotransferase elevations. The product label recommends evaluation of routine liver tests at baseline and thereafter as needed for patient management or if liver disease is suspected. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 3 times ULN should lead to interruption until the diagnosis of drug induced liver injury can be excluded. ALT or AST elevations above 20 times ULN or any elevations accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should lead to prompt discontinuation. Because of the possibility of reactivation of hepatitis B, it is appropriate to screen patients for hepatitis B markers before starting deucravacitinib and, if HBsAg or anti-HBc are present, providing antiviral prophylaxis or monitoring for reactivation during therapy. There does not appear to be cross reactivity in risk for hepatic injury among the various JAK and TYK2 kinase inhibitors, but few instances have been studied.</p>
