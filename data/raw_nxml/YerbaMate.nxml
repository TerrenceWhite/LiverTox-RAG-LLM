          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Yerba mate is a caffeinated herbal drink popular in South America that is used much like coffee or tea as a refreshing and stimulating beverage. It has recently become popular in the United States and Europe as a drink as well as a component of multiingredient dietary supplements. Yerba mate is generally regarded as safe and despite broad scale use has been recently linked to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="YerbaMate.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Yerba mate is prepared from the leaves and small stems of the evergreen tree, Ilex paraguariensis, that is native to Paraguay, Uruguay, and parts of Brazil and Argentina. Yerba mate as a beverage was first used by the native Guarani people and was later popularized by missionary Jesuits in the area which led to a more widespread use. Yerba mate is now a popular drink in South America prepared as tea or as a cold soft drink sold in bottles and cans. More recently, it has become a popular herbal drink in the United States and in Europe as well as a component in multiingredient herbal products. In preparation of Yerba mate, the leaves are typically baked, dried, and ground into a powder that may be flavored with citrus fruit or other flavoring substances and sold as a powder for preparing tea or made into a drinkable form and sold in bottles or cans. Yerba mate has multiple methylxanthines including caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline, and drinks made from the herb typically have concentrations of caffeine similar to those in tea and coffee. In addition, Yerba mate has polyphenols that are believed to be antioxidants as well as flavonoids (such as rutin and quercetin), anthocyanins, triterpene saponins, phytosterols, amino acids, minerals, and vitamins. Yerba mate is claimed to increase vitality and mental concentration and to decrease hunger. It is also purported to improve serum lipids, cause weight loss, decrease inflammation, benefit cardiovascular health, and even to prevent liver injury. The levels of caffeine may explain some of the effects found with Yerba mate, but the health promoting properties are usually attributed to its other components. The general health claims made for Yerba mate, however, have not been shown in rigorously controlled and adequately powered clinical trials, and it is not approved in the United States as therapy for any disease or condition. Nevertheless, Yerba mate is widely available as a powdered extract and as canned or bottled liquid drinks. Yerba mate extracts also are found in multiingredient dietary supplements, typically advertised as helpful for weight loss and for metabolic health, well-being, and longevity. The typical dose ranges widely and is difficult to estimate but is probably in the range of 1 to 3 grams daily. Side effects are uncommon but with excessive intake, caffeine related adverse events such as palpitations, nervousness, headache, and insomnia may arise. Epidemiologic studies suggest that long term use of Yerba mate may increase the risk of head and neck cancers.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="YerbaMate.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In small, short term clinical studies of different preparations and concentrations of Yerba mate, adverse side effects were usually described as absent or minimal with no mention of hepatotoxicity. Typical tests for liver and kidney injury or dysfunction were unchanged and normal. Despite these findings and its long history of use, Yerba mate has been implicated in causing liver injury in a few published cases. Details of the liver injury have not been well defined. In a recent case report, a 21 year old American man developed jaundice and itching after 4 months of drinking Yerba mate daily while visiting Argentina. The injury was strikingly hepatocellular with ALT and AST values more than 50 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), but alkaline phosphatase less than twice ULN, despite a bilirubin above 30 mg/dL. All known causes of acute hepatitis were excluded. Immune allergic symptoms (fever and rash) were not present and liver biopsy showed an acute hepatitis with cholestasis. The patient recovered without treatment within 2 months of stopping the herbal drink. While unusual, the case report was reasonably convincing as no other cause was evident, and improvement followed stopping the herbal drink. Thus, liver injury from Yerba mate might be considered possible but is exceedingly rare.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible but rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="YerbaMate.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Yerba mate has multiple constituents, and the chemical compound responsible for liver injury is not known. The clinical features of the single case of Yerba mate associated liver injury suggest that it was immunologically mediated. The injury resembled that of green tea or turmeric associated liver injury which are believed to be caused by polyphenols.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="YerbaMate.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The single carefully described case of liver injury from Yerba mate resolved spontaneously and completely once the herbal drink was discontinued. There is no information on cross sensitivity to liver injury with other similar herbal drinks.</p>
