          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Ritlecitinib is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) that is used to treat severe alopecia areata. Ritlecitinib is associated with a low rate of transient and usually mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy but has yet to be linked to cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ritlecitinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ritlecitinib (rit" le sye' ti nib) is an orally available, specific inhibitor Janus-associated kinases (mainly irreversible inhibition of JAK3) that is used to treat moderate-to-severe alopecia areata. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by hair loss resulting in patches and even complete baldness of the scalp, along with thinning or loss of eyebrows and eyelashes. The Janus kinases are critical steps in immune activation that transmit signals for different cytokine receptors and promote expression of genes involved in production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. JAK3, in particular, is a critical kinase in the cellular responses of interferon gamma, a cytokine found to be over-expressed in patients with alopecia areata. In multiple randomized controlled trials, ritlecitinib was found to decrease or reverse hair loss in patients with alopecia areata. Ritlecitinib was approved for this use in the United States in 2023, the 4th small molecule JAK inhibitor to receive approval, after ruxolitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor) in 2011, tofacitinib (JAK1/3 inhibitor) in 2012, and baricitinib (JAK 1/2 inhibitor) in 2018, and the 2nd JAK inhibitor approved as therapy for alopecia areata, after baricitinib in 2022. Ritlecitinib is available in capsules of 50 mg under the brand name Litfulo (Pfizer). The recommended dose is 50 mg once daily. Current indications are severe alopecia areata (as defined by 50% hair loss or greater) in adults and adolescents 12 years and older. Common side effects are headache, dizziness, diarrhea, pyrexia, stomatitis, infections, nasopharyngitis, acne, atopic dermatitis, folliculitis, urticaria, and rash. Ritlecitinib can also cause anemia, and creatine kinase elevations. Potential severe adverse events may include reactivation of fungal, viral, and opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis, herpes simplex, and herpes zoster and malignancies. Other JAK inhibitors have been linked to a higher rate of all-cause mortality and rarely to venous and arterial thromboses and to major atherosclerotic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ritlecitinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials in alopecia areata, serum aminotransferase elevations occurred in 1% to 3% of ritlecitinib treated subjects, but similar rates were found in placebo recipients. The elevations were typically mild and transient, and values above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in less than 1% of patients. The elevations rarely led to early discontinuations, and often resolved even without dose adjustment. In prelicensure studies in alopecia areata and other autoimmune conditions, there were no instances of liver related severe adverse events or clinically apparent liver injury attributed to ritlecitinib. Since approval and more widescale availability of ritlecitinib, there have been no published reports of hepatotoxicity associated with its use.</p>
          <p>Finally, ritlecitinib is an immune modulatory agent and has the potential of causing reactivation of viral infections including hepatitis B. Other JAK inhibitors have been implicated in rare instances of reactivation of hepatitis B, although the episodes were usually asymptomatic and self-limited in course. The risk of reactivation of hepatitis B in patients with HBsAg or with anti-HBc without HBsAg who are treated with ritlecitinib has not been defined.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unlikely cause of idiosyncratic clinically apparent liver injury, but is a potential cause of reactivation of hepatitis B).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ritlecitinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of mild serum enzyme elevations during ritlecitinib therapy is not known. Ritlecitinib is metabolized in the liver largely via CYP 3A4 and coadministration with strong inducers of CYP 3A4 should be avoided. Ritlecitinib is also an inhibitor of CYP 3A and 1A2 and can result in increases in serum levels of substrates of these two enzymes. The pharmacokinetics of ritlecitinib are not affected my mild-to-moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh A or B), but its use is not recommended in patients with severe impairment (Child-Pugh C).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ritlecitinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum aminotransferase elevations are uncommon during ritlecitinib therapy, but routine monitoring of liver tests is recommended in the product label &#x0201c;according to routine patient management.&#x0201d; Aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) should lead to at least temporary interruption of therapy until levels fall into the normal or near normal range. Elevations above 20 times the ULN or any elevations accompanied by symptoms or jaundice should lead to permanent discontinuation.</p>
          <p>Because of its potential to cause reactivation of hepatitis B, routine screening for HBsAg and anti-HBc before starting therapy with ritlecitinib is appropriate. Patients with HBsAg in serum should be treated prophylactically with an oral antiviral agent with activity against HBV such as entecavir or tenofovir. An alternative is to monitor patients carefully for HBV DNA levels to detect evidence of reactivation early and initiate appropriate therapy for HBV infection.</p>
