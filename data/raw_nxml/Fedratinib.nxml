          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Fedratinib is an oral selective inhibitor of Janus associated kinase 2 (JAK-2) and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that is used in the therapy of intermediate or high-risk, primary or secondary myelofibrosis. Fedratinib has been associated with a high rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has been associated with only rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Fedratinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Fedratinib (fed ra&#x02019; ti nib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of Janus associated kinase-2 (JAK-2) and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3), which are often mutated in patients with primary and secondary myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative, neoplastic syndrome that can present de novo (primary) or after transformation of polycythemia vera or essential thrombocytopenia (secondary). Clinical features include splenomegaly and debilitating constitutional symptoms of fatigue, fever, weight loss, bone pain, pruritus and failure to thrive. The bone marrow exhibits progressive replacement of marrow by fibrosis with associated anemia and thrombocytopenia. The marrow also frequently harbors mutated forms of JAK-2 [V617F] that are associated with dysregulation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, resulting in abnormal cell proliferation and unregulated production of growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Myelofibrosis is a pre-malignant syndrome that eventually transforms into leukemia in up to 20% of cases. Therapy for myelofibrosis is unsatisfactory. The JAK-1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved for use in myelofibrosis, but the response rate is less than 50%, and it is often poorly tolerated. The finding of frequent mutations in JAK-2 and FLT-3 in the bone marrow of patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis led to the clinical evaluation of fedratinib. In several preregistration trials, fedratinib resulted in reduction of splenomegaly and improvement in symptoms in 40% to 50% of patients, including those who were resistant to or intolerant of ruxolitinib. Fedratinib was approved in the United States as therapy for intermediate- or high-risk primary or secondary myelofibrosis in 2019. Fedratinib is available in capsules of 100 mg under the brand name Inrebic. The recommended dose is 400 mg once daily with dose reductions for adverse events. Common side effects include mild-to-moderate symptoms of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, headache, pruritus, muscle spasms, and elevations in serum creatinine, lipase, amylase and aminotransferase levels. Uncommon, but potentially serious side effects include severe anemia and thrombocytopenia, renal, pancreatic and liver toxicity, Wernicke&#x02019;s encephalopathy, secondary malignancies, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Fedratinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of fedratinib in patients with myelofibrosis, liver test abnormalities were common but also found in a proportion of patients treated with placebo or with a comparator drug. Some degree of ALT elevation arose in up to 58% of fedratinib treated patients, compared to 14% to 17% of those treated with placebo, but were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 9% or less and were usually not accompanied by symptoms or jaundice. Nevertheless, at least one case of severe acute hepatitis with hepatic failure was reported in an early study of fedratinib. Subsequently, with more careful monitoring, instances of clinically apparent liver injury were not reported. Clinical experience with fedratinib since its approval has been limited.</p>
          <p>In addition, long term treatment with fedratinib and other Janus kinase inhibitors has been linked to rare instances of reactivation of hepatitis B that can be severe and even fatal. Reactivation often becomes clinically apparent after the JAK inhibitor is discontinued, when immune restoration results in an immunologic response to the heightened viral replication.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury including reactivation of hepatitis B in susceptible patients).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Fedratinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of liver injury from fedratinib is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities suggests some degree of low level, direct hepatotoxicity. Thus, minor ALT elevations levels occur in over 40% of treated patients, but they are usually asymptomatic and transient, resolving even without dose modification or interruption. Fedratinib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce the CYP enzyme reactivity.</p>
          <p>Reactivation of hepatitis B by JAK inhibitors, in contrast, is likely due to indirect effects caused by immune suppression, which may to lead to increased HBV replication and which, if followed by immune recovery, can result in acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Fedratinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Patients receiving fedratinib should be tested before starting therapy for thiamine levels, complete blood count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, routine liver tests and amylase and lipase levels. These tests should then be monitored as clinically indicated during therapy. Serum aminotransferase elevations typically arise within 1 to 3 months of starting fedratinib and are mild. Levels above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) should lead to dose reduction or temporary interruption. In patients who develop clinical symptoms or jaundice with these elevations, fedratinib should be promptly discontinued, and restarting therapy should be done with caution and close monitoring. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the tyrosine kinase inhibitors but there is no information on shared adverse event sensitivity between other JAK inhibitors (such as ruxolitinib) and fedratinib.</p>
          <p>Other JAK inhibitors such as baricitinib, tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, and upadacitinib have been linked to cases of reactivation of hepatitis B which can be severe. Importantly, patients who are to receive long term therapy with fedratinib should be screened for hepatitis B (HBsAg and anti-HBc). Patients with HBsAg in serum should be treated prophylactically with an oral antiviral agent with activity against HBV such as entecavir or tenofovir. An alternative, which is applicable to those with anti-HBc without HBsAg, is to monitor patients carefully for HBV DNA levels to detect evidence of reactivation early and initiate appropriate therapy for HBV infection.</p>
