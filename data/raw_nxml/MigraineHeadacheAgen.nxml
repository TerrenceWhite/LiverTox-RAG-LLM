        <title>OVERVIEW</title>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Migraine headaches are marked by repeated, paroxysmal attacks of moderate-to-severe throbbing, one-sided headaches which (without treatment) last 4 to 72 hours and are usually associated with symptoms of nausea and vomiting. Migraine headaches are typically exacerbated by motion, bright lights and loud noises. Migraines may be associated with focal neurological symptoms referred to as &#x0201c;aura&#x0201d; which are typically visual, but may be sensory or motor. Migraine headaches are common, affecting at least 18% of women and 6.5% of men in the United States. The pattern of paroxysmal headaches typically arises in adolescence or young adulthood and may be life-long. The headaches often interfere with daily activities and can be incapacitating, result in major time lost from work and precipitate multiple physician and emergency room visits. Patients with migraine may also be at increased risk for other vascular complications such as stroke and eclampsia.</p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">The cause of migraine headaches is not fully understood, but appears to be related to arteriolar vasodilation and inflammation of the trigeminal nerve endings, perhaps caused by local release of vasoactive peptides. Serotonin activity appears to lessen the pain and symptoms of migraine and serotonin receptor agonists have been developed that have activity against acute migraine. However, the most convincing candidate mediator of migraines is the calcitonin gene related protein (CGRP), a neuropeptide with potent vasodilator and pain-signaling activities. CGRP is found throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems but is particularly active in trigeminal ganglia. Circulating levels of CGRP are elevated in patients with migraines, and the efficacy of migraine therapies such as serotonin receptor agonists and ergot alkaloids is associated with lowering of circulating CGRP levels. Antagonists of CGRP have become a focus of migraine headache prevention and therapy.</p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Therapy of migraine headache usually combines preventive treatments with early intervention for acute attacks. Early treatment approaches to migraine have included a number of different classes of medications, including analgesics such as aspirin, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and opiates, barbiturates, antiemetics, ergot alkaloids, two types of serotonin receptor agonists (triptans and ditans), and oral, small molecule CGRP antagonists.</p>
        <p>For mild migraine headaches, commonly used analgesics such as NSAIDS and aspirin are often effective. They are approved for therapy of headaches, but not specifically for migraine headaches. Opiate analgesics should be avoided. Other medications such as barbiturates and antiemetics are often used, but treat some of the other symptoms of migraine such as nausea and dizziness.</p>
        <p>The ergot alkaloids are generally the first line of therapy for migraines. They are inexpensive and have been in use for many years. They do have side effects that can be severe. Currently available forms include ergotamine (Cafergot: year of approval, 1948) and dihydroergotamine (Migranal: 1946). They are used only for treatment of acute attacks.</p>
        <p>The triptans which are specific agonists of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>1B/D</sub> receptors, are perhaps the most reliable and most common used therapies for acute migraine. Triptans in current use include sumatriptan (Imitrex: 1997), zolmitriptan (Zomig: 1997), naratriptan (Amerge: 1998), rizatriptan (Maxalt: 1998), almotriptan (Almogran, Axert: 2001), frovatriptan (Frova: 2001), and eletriptan (Relpax: 2002). Most of these are now available in generic and less expensive forms.</p>
        <p>The ditans are highly selective 5-HT<sub>1F</sub> receptor agonists and lack the vasoconstrictive activity of the triptans. The sole ditan approved for use in migraine headache is lasmiditan (Reyvow: 2019). Lasmiditan has had limited clinical use and, because of its price and relatively modest degree of efficacy, is usually limited to patients in whom triptans are contraindicated or have failed to control severe migraine attacks.</p>
        <p>The identification of CGRP as an important mediator of vasodilation and pain in patients with migraine led to development of potent and well tolerated small molecule, oral CGRP antagonists as agents to treat acute attacks as well as long acting, monoclonal antibodies to CGRP or its receptor to prevent episodic and chronic migraine. The small molecule CGRP receptor inhibitors include ubrogepant (Ubrelvy: 2019) and rimegepant (Nurtec-ODT: 2020). These agents (the &#x0201c;gepants&#x0201d;) are given by mouth at the time of onset of migraine and have not been approved for chronic use to prevent migraines. The monoclonal antibodies to CGRP include fremanezumab (Ajovy: 2018), galcanezumab (Emgality: 2018) and eptinezumab (Vyepti: 2019) and the CGRP receptor, erenumab (Aimovig: 2018). These agents are given subcutaneously once monthly or every three months and have been found to reduce the frequency of migraines but rarely to eliminate them completely. They are not effective in treatment of ongoing, acute migraine.</p>
        <p>Other therapies for prevention of migraine are mostly used off label and have limited efficacy. These preventive agents include valproate, topiramate, various beta-blockers, candesartan, antidepressants, and botulinum toxin type A.</p>
        <p>The ergot alkaloids, triptans and ditans rarely if ever cause liver injury, perhaps because they are used for a short time only and in low doses. The monoclonal antibody and small molecule antagonists to CGRP have had limited general use, but appear to be free of significant hepatotoxicity. Rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury have been described in patients taking zolmitriptan and rizatriptan.</p>
        <p>General references on the safety and hepatotoxicity of the drugs used specifically for migraine are provided with this introductory section. References specific to the individual agents are provided in separate chapters on the general class of agents (ergot alkaloids and the triptans) or on the specific individual agent.</p>
