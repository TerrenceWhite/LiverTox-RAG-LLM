          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Rimegepant is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor that blocks the action of CGRP, a potent vasodilator believed to play a role in migraine headaches. Rimegepant is approved for both treatment and prevention of acute migraine attacks. In clinical trials, rimegepant was generally well tolerated with only rare instances of transient serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and with no reported instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Rimegepant (ri me&#x02019; je pant) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the receptor for the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches. CGRP is a potent vasodilator and pain-signaling neurotransmitter that is found throughout the central and peripheral nervous system but is particularly common in trigeminal ganglia. Levels of CGRP are elevated during episodes of migraine headache, and administration of the peptide can induce migraines in susceptible patients. For this reason, approaches to inhibition of CGRP signaling were developed as potential therapies for migraine, both as preventive therapies to decrease the rate of migraine as well as for treatment of acute attacks. Several small molecule inhibitors of the CGRP receptor (the &#x0201c;gepants&#x0201d;: atogepant, rimegepant, ubrogepant, and zavegepant) are available for treatment or prevention of acute migraine. Only rimegepant is approved for both indications. In several randomized, placebo controlled trials, rimegepant in doses of 75 mg orally (or sublingually) was found to increase the rate of being free of headache pain by two hours after administration [20% to 21% vs 11% to 12% with placebo] and also being free of the most bothersome other symptoms [35% to 38% vs 25% to 27% with placebo]. Rimegepant was approved for treatment of acute migraine in the United States in 2020, the second oral CGRP receptor antagonist approved for this indication. Indications were expanded in 2021 to also include prevention of acute attacks in patients with episodic migraine. Rimegepant is available in orally disintegrating tablets of 75 mg under the brand name Nurtec ODT. The recommended dose is 75 mg orally as soon as possible after onset of migraine. The dose should not exceed 75 mg during any 24-hour period. Rimegepant can be used by patients receiving preventive therapy with monoclonal antibodies to CGRP or its receptor. The recommended dose for prevention of migraines is 75 mg every other day. Rimegepant is generally well tolerated with side effects of nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and dry mouth that are generally uncommon (&#x0003c;5%), transient and mild-to-moderate in severity. Hypersensitivity reactions (largely rash and dyspnea) have arisen in rare cases, but more severe adverse events have not been reported.</p>

        <sec id="Rimegepant.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In preregistration controlled trials of rimegepant in several thousand patients, mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations arose in a small percentage of patients (1% to 2%) and overall rates were not different from those in placebo recipients. In the controlled trials and subsequently with general use, there have been no reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to rimegepant. In contrast, telcagepant, the initial oral CGRP receptor antagonist evaluated as therapy for migraine headaches, was abandoned during development because of several instances of clinically apparent liver injury in recipients that was characterized by marked elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and symptoms of fatigue, nausea and abdominal discomfort arising within 2 to 4 weeks of starting therapy which rapidly resolved with stopping therapy. Similar episodes have not been reported with rimegepant.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Rimegepant.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Possible mechanisms of liver injury due to rimegepant are not known. It is metabolized in the liver largely by CYP 3A4 and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that induced or inhibit this microsomal enzyme.</p>
