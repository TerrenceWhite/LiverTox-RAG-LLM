          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Enfortumab vedotin is a human monoclonal antibody conjugate that is used in the therapy of refractory, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. Enfortumab vedotin has been linked to transient, mild-to-moderate serum enzyme elevations during therapy but has not been implicated in instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Enfortumab.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Enfortumab (en for&#x02019; tue mab) vedotin (ve doe&#x02019; tin) is a human monoclonal antibody to Nectin-4, a cell adhesion molecule that is highly expressed on urothelial carcinoma cells and that appears to contribute to cancerous cell growth and proliferation. The monoclonal antibody is conjugated using a linker sequence to a cytotoxic molecule, vedotin monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) that disturbs microtubule formation resulting in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. When enfortumab binds to Nectin-4, it is internalized and the vedotin is released by the action of lysosomal enzymes, which cleave the short linker molecule that joins the antibody and the cytotoxic molecule. Once released, the intracellular vedotin binds to microtubules preventing their participation in cell division resulting in apoptotic cell death of the rapidly dividing malignant urothelial cells. This monoclonal antibody conjugate has been shown to be effective in inducing remissions in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who previously have been treated with platinum-containing regimens and check point inhibitors. Combined with pembrolizumab (a check point inhibitor monoclonal antibody to PD-1), enfortumab vedotin also demonstrated efficacy in patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who are not eligible to receive the cisplatin-containing regimens. Enfortumab vedotin was given accelerated approval for these indications in the United States in 2019. It is available as lyophilized powder for reconstitution in single dose vials of 20 and 30 mg under the brand name Padcev. The typical recommended dose regimen is 1.25 mg/kg (up to 125 mg) administered by intravenous infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of 28-day cycles or (when given with pembrolizumab) on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles and continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects are common and may include infusion reactions, nausea, abdominal pain, anorexia, weakness, fatigue, headache, dizziness, itching, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, dry eyes, dry skin, and rash. Enfortumab vedotin can also cause myelosuppression and decreases in hemoglobin, white cells, and platelets, as well as increases in liver enzymes, creatinine, urate, and lipase. Less common, but potentially serious side effects include peripheral neuropathy, hypersensitivity reactions, severe myelosuppression, pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, and fetal-embryonal toxicity. Enfortumab vedotin should be administered only by physicians with training and expertise in cancer chemotherapy and management of its potential adverse effects.</p>

        <sec id="Enfortumab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In preregistration trials of enfortumab vedotin, serum aminotransferase elevations occurred in 20% to 40% of patients with ALT levels above 5 times ULN in only 3%, leading to dose interruptions in 2% and permanent discontinuations in 1%. Nevertheless, there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. The product label for enfortumab vedotin mentions ALT and AST elevations as occurring during therapy, which are probably more frequent in those who are also receiving pembrolizumab. After its approval and more widespread use, there have been no instances of clinically apparent liver injury reported in the literature, but several instances of suspected liver injury from enfortumab vedotin have been reported to the FDA.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (suspected but unproven cause of clinically significant liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Enfortumab.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of the serum enzyme elevations during enfortumab vedotin therapy is not known, but it is likely due to direct toxicity of the vedotin conjugate rather than the monoclonal antibody. Because enfortumab vedotin is sometimes given with pembrolizumab, instances of immune mediated liver injury are likely to occur with therapy, but probably are due to the checkpoint inhibitor rather than the monoclonal conjugate.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Enfortumab.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for enfortumab vedotin does not recommend routine monitoring of liver tests, and aminotransferase elevations that occur with therapy are generally transient, mild and asymptomatic and rarely require dose modification or delay in therapy. Elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal, if detected, should lead to more careful monitoring and suspension of further infusions, at least until levels return to normal or near normal levels. Elevations above 20 times the ULN or any elevation accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should lead to prompt permanent discontinuation.</p>
