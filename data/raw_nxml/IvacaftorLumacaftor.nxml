          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor are orally available potentiators or correctors of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that are used to treat patients with cystic fibrosis with specific mutations of the CFTR. Ivacaftor alone or in combination with lumacaftor or tezacaftor has been associated with low rate of transient serum enzyme elevations during treatment, but not with clinically apparent acute liver injury with jaundice, while the addition of elexacaftor to ivacaftor and tezacaftor has been implicated in a higher rate of serum enzyme elevations (up to 10% of patients) and to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="IvacaftorLumacaftor.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a severe inherited disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), which results in impaired clearance of mucous secretions leading to progressive pancreatic and pulmonary dysfunction, considerable disability and early mortality. CF is considered the most common, fatal genetic disorder among Caucasians, affecting approximately 1:2000 persons of European descent. Disease manifestations generally arise in childhood and include pancreatic insufficiency, poor nutrition, failure to thrive and progressive lung disease with frequent respiratory infections and pulmonary exacerbations. Survival is poor, but has improved greatly with medical interventions and attention to maintenance of rigorous pulmonary hygiene, preventive or rapid treatment of respiratory infections and proper nutritional management. The discovery that the disease was caused by mutations in the CFTR gene led to a focused search for small molecules that might improve, correct or potentiate abnormal CFTR function. A major problem was the diversity of mutations found in CF and the variability in how these mutations affected gene function (proper folding of the mature CFTR protein, trafficking of the protein to the proper place in the plasma membrane, channel opening and maintenance of the open configuration). Nevertheless, several agents were identified that were potentiators or correctors ("tor") of the CFTR ("caf") and could improve respiratory function, sense of well being and nutrition and decrease pulmonary exacerbations in patients with CF who had agent-specific mutations in the CFTR gene. Currently, four &#x0201c;caftors&#x0201d; are available clinically &#x02013; ivacaftor, lumacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor. The combination of three of these modulators &#x02013; elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor &#x02013; has become the standard of care and is effective in improving pulmonary function and symptoms in up to 85% of patients, a major milestone in management of this important genetic disease.</p>
          <p>Ivacaftor (eye" va kaf' tor) was the first CFTR modulator to become available for use in the United States. It potentiates the opening of the CFTR channel in patients who harbor at least one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ivacaftor based upon clinical or in vitro assay data, such as the Gly551Asp (also abbreviated as G551D) CFTR mutation. Ivacaftor was approved in the United States for use in patients with the CFTR Gly551Asp mutation in 2012 and is available as monotherapy in tablets of 150 mg and as oral granules in packets of 50 and 75 mg under the brand name Kalydeco. The recommended dose in adults and children above 6 years of age is 150 mg orally every 12 hours. The dose in children less than 6 years of age is based upon body weight. The Gly551Asp mutation is found in approximately 5% of patients with CF.</p>
          <p>Lumacaftor (loo" ma kaf' tor) is a "corrector" of the CFTR and was the second agent to gain approval as therapy of CF, but was approved for use only in combination with ivacaftor, and specifically for patients who are homozygous for the Phe508del (F508del) mutation in the CFTR. Phen508del is the most frequent mutation in CFTR found in patients with CF and is associated with a lack of trafficking of the transporter to the cell surface. In vitro, lumacaftor was found to partially correct this trafficking error. Lumacaftor combined with ivacaftor was approved for use in patients homozygous for Phe508del CFTR in 2015 and is available as tablets consisting of 200 mg of lumacaftor and 125 mg of ivacaftor under the brand name Orkambi. Side effects of these agents are generally mild, but can include headache, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness and rash.</p>
          <p>Tezacaftor (tez" a kaf' tor) is a "corrector" of the CFTR and was the third agent to gain approval, but only in combination with ivacaftor, and specifically for patients who are homozygous for the Phe508Del (F508del) mutation in the CFTR or are heterozygous and have another mutation in CFTR found in patients with CF and is associated with a lack of trafficking of the transporter to the cell surface. In vitro, tezacaftor was found to partially correct this trafficking error. Tezacaftor combined with ivacaftor was approved for use in the United States as therapy for patients with cystic fibrosis in 2018 and is available as tablets of fixed dose of 100 mg tezacaftor with 150 mg of ivacaftor co-packaged with tablets of 150 mg of ivacaftor alone under the brand name Symdeko. Side effects of these agents are generally mild but can include headache, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, dizziness and rash.</p>
          <p>Elexacaftor (el ex&#x0201d; a kaf&#x02019; tor) is also a &#x0201c;corrector&#x0201d; of the CFTR and was the fourth agent to gain approval, but only in combination with ivacaftor and tezacaftor (triple therapy). Initially evaluated in patients who were homozygous for the Phe508del allele, further trials showed that it was effective in patients with only one Phe508 allele and a variety of second mutated alleles. Clinical trials of this triple combination therapy was found to rapidly improve pulmonary function tests and clinical symptoms resulting in a decrease in acute exacerbations and sweat chloride concentrations, weight gain and improved pulmonary function and quality of life. Triple therapy with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor was approved for use in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 12 years or older with at least one Phen508del allele in the United States in 2019 under the brand name Trikafta. The recommended dosage is two tablets of a fixed combination of 100 mg of elexacaftor, 50 mg of tezacaftor, and 75 mg of ivacaftor each morning and a second tablet of ivacaftor 150 mg alone each evening. Because approximately 85% of patients with cystic fibrosis have at least one Phe508del allele, triple therapy is applicable to most patients and has replaced previous combinations of &#x0201c;caftors&#x0201d; as the standard of therapy.</p>
          <p>Common side effects of triple therapy include an initial worsening of cough, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, nasal congestion and dyspnea, elevations in ALT, bilirubin and CPK, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rash. Less common but potentially severe complications include cataracts, pancreatitis and acute cholecystitis.</p>

        <sec id="IvacaftorLumacaftor.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In large randomized controlled trials of ivacaftor with or without lumacaftor or tezacaftor, up to 25% of subjects had some degree of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy. The elevations, however, were generally transient and mild and were above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in only 2% to 5% of patients. The abnormalities were usually asymptomatic and often resolved spontaneously without dose adjustment. Furthermore, in several studies, similar rates of serum enzyme elevations were noted in the placebo treated groups. Nevertheless, serum aminotransferase elevations resulted in dose modification or interruption in 1% to 2% of patients on ivacaftor alone or with lumacaftor or tezacaftor.</p>
          <p>In prelicensure clinical trials of the triple therapy of elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor, higher rates of serum enzyme elevations were reported which in some cases were accompanied by elevations in serum bilirubin. Most abnormalities resolved spontaneously and enzymes rapidly improved upon discontinuation. Since approval of triple therapy, several case reports of clinically apparent liver injury including jaundice have been reported, generally arising after weeks or months of treatment and resolving with discontinuation. In addition, case series of acute cholecystitis developing within days or weeks of starting triple therapy have been reported, and are probably due to the increased biliary fluid secretion and clearance of biliary sludge and stones with the sudden increased bile flow. Gallstones are frequent in patients with cystic fibrosis and often result in cholecystectomy. There have been no reports of acute liver failure, chronic hepatitis or vanishing bile duct syndrome linked to elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor therapy. Patients with cystic fibrosis can, not infrequently, have underlying liver disease with chronic, intermittent serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase elevations, occasionally associated with progressive fibrosis or nodular regenerative hyperplasia and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.</p>

        <sec id="IvacaftorLumacaftor.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which elexacaftor with tezacaftor and ivacaftor might cause liver injury is not known. Ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor are extensively metabolized by the liver by the cytochrome P450 system (largely CYP 3A) and liver injury might be caused by a toxic or immunogenic product of their metabolism. Triple therapy is susceptible to drug-drug interactions, particularly with strong inducers (such as rifampin and St. John's wort), which may result in suboptimal drug levels or strong inhibitors of CYP 3A4 (such as ketoconazole) that might result in higher than normal drug levels.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="IvacaftorLumacaftor.Outcome_and_Manageme">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>While chronic therapy with elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor can be associated with mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations, they have rarely been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury. Monitoring of routine liver tests is recommended for patients starting triple therapy with repeat testing while on therapy every 3 months for one year and annually thereafter. Patients who develop aminotransferase elevations on therapy should be monitored more frequently, and dosing should be interrupted if symptoms or jaundice appear or if aminotransferase levels rise above 5 times ULN, with caution in restarting once they fall into the normal range. The safety and efficacy of these agents in patients with CF and significant liver disease has not been demonstrated and increased monitoring and caution is appropriate in patients with preexisting liver abnormalities.</p>
