          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tepotinib is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) factor tyrosine kinase receptor that is used to treat selected cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Serum aminotransferase elevations are common during therapy with tepotinib, but it has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Tepotinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tepotinib (tep oh&#x02019; ti nib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) factor tyrosine kinase receptor that blocks the binding of its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which normally activates signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, motility, and invasion. The MET gene is mutated or overexpressed in several human cancers including lung, liver, breast and ovarian. Tepotinib has special activity against the mutated variant of the MET receptor produced by exon 14 skipping which is found in 3% to 4% of refractory NSCLC. Tepotinib was found to inhibit cancer cell growth in several tissue culture and animal models of MET dysregulated cancers. In a moderately sized (n=255), open label trial, tepotinib was found to induce objective responses in 43% of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer harboring MET mutations regardless of previous treatment status. Tepotinib was approved in the United States in 2021 for adults with unresectable or advanced NSCLC with documented mutations that cause MET exon 14 skipping, the second such tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for this indication (the first being capmatinib). Tepotinib is available in tablets of 225 mg under the brand name Tepmetko. The recommended dose is 450 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects are common and arise in almost all patients treated with tepotinib. Severe adverse reactions occur in up to 45% of patients and lead to dose interruptions in 44%, dose adjustments in 30%, and permanent discontinuations in 20%. Common side effects include edema, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, anorexia, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, fever, cough, dyspnea, and rash. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, hepatotoxicity, photosensitivity, hypersensitivity reactions, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>

        <sec id="Tepotinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of tepotinib in patients with solid tumors harboring MET mutations, liver test abnormalities were frequent although usually self-limited and mild. Some degree of ALT elevations arose in 44% of tepotinib treated patients and were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 4%. In these trials that enrolled 255 patients, dose interruptions due to ALT or AST elevations occurred in 3%, but permanent discontinuations in less than 1%. The liver test abnormalities had a median onset of 30 days after initiation of therapy. While serum aminotransferase elevations were occasionally quite high (5 to 20 times upper limit of normal), there were no accompanying elevations in serum bilirubin and no patient developed clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. The product label for tepotinib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests before, at 2 week intervals during the first 3 months of therapy, and monthly thereafter as clinically indicated.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tepotinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from tepotinib is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities suggests direct liver injury. Tepotinib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4 and 2C8, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce these CYPs. Tepotinib is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and concurrent use of a P-gp substrate may lead to serious toxicities. Because of known additive toxicity, concomitant use of drugs that are known P-gp substrates should be avoided or the dose of tepotinib adjusted accordingly.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tepotinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for tepotinib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests before starting treatment, at 2 week intervals during the first 3 months of treatment and monthly thereafter as clinically indicated. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation of tepotinib therapy and careful monitoring. Restarting therapy in a reduced dose can be done with caution and continued monitoring. In patients with jaundice or symptoms of liver injury accompanying the serum aminotransferase elevations, tepotinib should be promptly discontinued and not restarted. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the antineoplastic, small molecule enzyme and tyrosine receptor inhibitors, but currently there is no information on shared adverse event sensitivity of tepotinib with other antineoplastic kinase inhibitors including capmatinib.</p>
