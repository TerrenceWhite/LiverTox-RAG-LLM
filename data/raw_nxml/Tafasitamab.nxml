          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Tafasitamab is a cytotoxic monoclonal antibody against CD19 that is used in combination with other antineoplastic agents to treat adults with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Tafasitamab therapy is associated with a low rate of mild serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tafasitamab.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Tafasitamab (ta&#x0201d; fa sit&#x02019; a mab) is Fc modified, humanized, cytolytic monoclonal antibody against CD19 that is used to treat adults with advanced, relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies, including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Tafasitamab binds to CD19 which is expressed on pre- and mature B lymphocytes inducing antibody dependent cytolysis or apoptosis. Tafasitamab treatment lowers peripheral B cells, and chronic therapy is effective in inducing remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell lymphomas. Tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide was approved in the United States in 2020 for treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who are not candidates for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Tafasitamab is available as a powder for reconstitution in single use vials of 200 mg under the brand name Monjuvi. The recommended dose regimen is 12 mg/kg intravenously on 2 to 5 days of each 28 day course; for the initial 28 day cycle on days 1, 4, 8, 15, and 22, for cycles 2 and 3 on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, and for subsequent cycles on days 1 and 15. Tafasitamab should be administered with daily oral lenalidomide for no more than 12 cycles, but can be continued as monotherapy thereafter. Therapy should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occur. Premedication with antihistamines, H2 blockers, or glucocorticoids is recommended. The combination of tafasitamab and lenalidomide has many adverse events that require monitoring and careful management. Common adverse events include neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, cough, pyrexia, peripheral edema, respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, decreased appetite, and rash. Serious adverse events include severe myelosuppression, severe infections, infusion site reactions, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Tafasitamab should be administered only by health care providers with knowledge and experience with myelosuppressive immunotherapy of cancer.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tafasitamab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In small, preregistration open label trials, serum ALT elevations occurred in 11% of tafasitamab treated subjects but were generally transient and mild, and there were no instances of ALT elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or clinically apparent liver injury with symptoms or jaundice. Since the approval of tafasitamab in 2020, there have been no case reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to its use. Monoclonal antibodies to CD19 have been used for other indications and similarly have been free of liver injury. These B cell directed monoclonal antibodies, however, are considered possible causes of reactivation of hepatitis B and prescreening for hepatitis B status is usually recommended. At least one case of reactivation of hepatitis B was reported in the follow up of the open label registration trial of tafasitamab and lenalidomide therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury except as a result of reactivation of hepatitis B).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tafasitamab.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The causes of the mild liver test abnormalities during tafasitamab therapy are not clearly known but appear to be related to the underlying condition, other neoplastic agents (lenalidomide for instance) or comorbidities. Tafasitamab can cause hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria and rash, and liver injury might be a part of the immunoallergic reaction. Cases of reactivation of hepatitis B were not observed during prelicensure studies and should not occur with adequate prescreening and prophylaxis against reactivation.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Tafasitamab.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for tafasitamab does not recommend monitoring of routine liver tests during therapy. Nevertheless, if detected, de novo elevations of serum aminotransferase levels above 5 times the ULN or baseline values should lead to temporary discontinuation and evaluation for other possible causes of liver injury, restarting therapy only when values return to normal or near normal and with careful subsequent monitoring. Screening of candidates for therapy for evidence of hepatitis B (for HBsAg and anti-HBc) is appropriate and, if positive, consultation for advice on the need for prophylaxis or prospective monitoring.</p>
