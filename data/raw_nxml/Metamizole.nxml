          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Metamizole, also known as dipyrone, is an oral analgesic that is not available in the United States but is available over-the-counter in many countries of the world. Therapy with metamizole has been associated with rare severe bone marrow and liver adverse events including agranulocytosis, acute hepatitis, and acute liver failure.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Metamizole.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Metamizole (me tam&#x02019; i zole), also known as dipyrone (dye&#x02019; pir on), is a widely used oral agent for moderate-to-severe pain, fever, and spasm that is banned and not available in the United States but is widely used and available over-the-counter in other selected countries and areas of the world, including Germany, Russia, Mexico, South America, and China. First patented in 1922 and marketed under the names Novalgin and Analgin, metamizole was a popular and widely prescribed analgesic. However, because of reports of agranulocytosis, it was withdrawn from the market in the United States and subsequently in the United Kingdom, France, Canada, India, Japan, and Australia. Nevertheless, it remained available by prescription as well as over-the-counter in many other countries. Metamizole is a well tolerated drug and has fewer common side effects than aspirin and nonsteroid antiinflammatory agents (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Metamizole also has antipyretic and spasmolytic activities and was frequently used for postoperative pain and fever. The European Medicines Agency conducted an extensive review of its efficacy, safety, and benefit-to-risk ratio, concluding that metamizole was generally safe and that agranulocytosis and liver injury occurred with its use, but rarely and not much more commonly than with other over the counter analgesics. In selected countries, metamizole is available in tablets for oral use, suppositories for rectal administration, and in solution for intramuscular or intravenous use. The recommended oral dosage is 500 to 1,000 mg orally 1 to 4 times a day as needed. Dipyrone in solution is also available for intramuscular or intravenous use. Common adverse events include nausea, vomiting, headache, weakness, fever, abdominal pain, somnolence, vertigo, spams, neutropenia, renal dysfunction, and rash. Rare but potentially serious adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions, urticaria, angioedema, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, interstitial nephritis, tachycardia, hypotension, shock, and agranulocytosis (estimated incidence ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:1,000,000 exposed persons).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Metamizole.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Cases of liver injury from metamizole were rarely reported before 2019 when two case series of liver injury from its use including fatalities were reported from Germany. Reassessments were conducted by the European Medicines Agency based upon accumulation of more than 40 cases. Within a year or two, reviews of more than 50 cases of clinically apparent liver injury due to metamizole were described. The clinical features of metamizole-associated liver injury have varied greatly, some being hyper-acute with rapid onset of fever, rash, and jaundice after the initial or first several doses. These cases may represent hypersensitivity reactions such as hepatic involvement in DRESS syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome.</p>
          <p>In other instances, metamizole induced liver injury arises during more prolonged therapy after a latency of 2 to 16 weeks, manifested by the gradual onset of fatigue, nausea, anorexia, and right upper quadrant discomfort followed by dark urine and jaundice. The enzyme elevations are typically hepatocellular, but mixed and even cholestatic patterns have been described. The disease is usually self-limited with rapid improvement once metamizole is stopped. Rash, fever, and eosinophilia arise in some cases but are generally transient and mild. Autoantibodies including ANA and AMA are frequently detected, but IgG levels are usually normal and liver histology does not resemble autoimmune hepatitis. Recovery is usually rapid once metamizole is stopped and rarely requires immunosuppressive therapy. As might be expected, the fatality rate appears to be at least 10% in cases with hepatocellular injury and jaundice. There have been reports of fatalities and need for liver transplants due to liver injury caused by the drug. Recurrence upon re-exposure is usually abrupt in onset and more severe in course than the initial episode.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: A (well described although rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Metamizole.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The causes of the liver injuries from metamizole are likely to be immune mediated and the two patterns of injury suggest an immediate hypersensitivity reaction and a more delayed adaptive immune mediated injury. Metamizole can cause hypersensitivity reactions without liver injury including urticaria and rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Patients who develop agranulocytosis due to metamizole frequently have accompanying liver injury that is generally mild and overshadowed by the hematologic events.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Metamizole.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Metamizole should be discontinued immediately in any patient presenting with acute liver injury and held until the diagnosis is clear. While metamizole is not available in the United States, immigrants from areas of the world where it is used may bring or order metamizole (frequently called dipyrone) from their countries of origin and may not report its use to physicians because it is considered a common, safe, over-the-counter medication. There is little evidence that immunosuppressive therapy is beneficial, although it is often used when improvement does not occur rapidly upon withdrawal of metamizole. The drug should not be restarted in anyone with suspected metamizole liver injury. Furthermore, patients taking the drug should be encouraged to discontinue it because of its propensity to cause serious side effects.</p>
