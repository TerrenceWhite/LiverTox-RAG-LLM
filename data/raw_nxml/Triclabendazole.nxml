          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Triclabendazole is an oral anthelmintic used in the treatment of chronic fascioliasis. Triclabendazole therapy is generally well tolerated but can be accompanied by abdominal pain, nausea and mild liver test abnormalities, which are probably due to the expulsion of dead or dying flukes rather than hepatic injury due to the therapy.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Triclabendazole.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Triclabendazole (tri cla ben&#x02019; a zole) is a benzimidazole derivative and anthelmintic used as therapy of fascioliasis. Fasciola hepatica and gigantica are two species of trematodes that infect livestock and can secondarily infect humans. Fascioliasis is found in more than 50 countries, especially where sheep or cattle are reared. Except for parts of Western Europe, human fascioliasis occurs mainly in developing countries. The life cycle of Fasciola starts with release of immature eggs in the stool of infected humans or animals, which after several weeks release miracidia. The miracidia attach to amphibian snails, penetrate their skin and undergo asexual reproduction into hundreds of cercariae which leave the snails and encyst and attach to aquatic vegetation becoming metacercariae, the form that infects humans, livestock and other mammals. Once ingested Fasciola passes through the duodenal wall into the peritoneum, through Glisson&#x02019;s capsule into the liver where it migrates to the biliary tree and matures into adult flukes. Acute fascioliasis occurs as the organism traverses the duodenum and liver is associated with fever, abdominal pains, urticaria, eosinophilia, hepatosplenomegaly and jaundice. With chronic infection, biliary symptoms and obstruction can occur with recurrent cholangitis and pancreatitis. The diagnosis of chronic fascioliasis is made by finding Fasciola eggs in stool or by specific serologic tests for antibodies. Triclabendazole is currently the drug of choice for therapy of chronic fascioliasis and, with correct dosing, can achieve cure in 75% to 95% of patients. Triclabendazole has been used as an anthelmintic in humans for three decades, but was first formally approved for use in the United States in 2019 on the basis of published and historic studies of its efficacy and safety. Current indications are for patients, 6 years and older, with documented chronic fascioliasis. The recommended treatment regimen is two doses of 10 mg/kg given orally 12 hours apart. Documentation of the absence of Fasciola eggs in stool samples taken 3 months after therapy is generally considered evidence of efficacy and cure. Side effects starting on the day of treatment and lasting a few days include abdominal pain [in 50% to 95% of patients], nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhea, rash, urticaria, pruritus and eosinophilia. Severe adverse events are rare. In laboratory animals, triclabendazole can prolong the QT interval.</p>

        <sec id="Triclabendazole.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>The published and historic controlled trials of triclabendazole in chronic fascioliasis rarely described adverse event rates or blood test results except for eosinophilia. Instances of enzyme elevations and jaundice have been described, but patients with chronic fascioliasis often have minor elevations in liver tests. Furthermore, the common side effects of treatment are most likely due to the effects of sudden expulsion of the liver flukes from the biliary tree, which can result in transient serum ALT and alkaline phosphatase elevations and even jaundice. There are no reports of serious liver injury, acute liver failure, vanishing bile duct syndrome or chronic hepatitis after triclabendazole therapy. There are reports of cholestatic hepatic injury and vanishing bile duct syndrome linked to other benzimidazole anthelmintic agents such as thiabendazole and albendazole. There is also reported association between Fasciola infection with the potential for bile duct obstruction and sequelae.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Triclabendazole.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The most likely reason for lack of clinically apparent hepatotoxicity from triclabendazole is the single day therapeutic regimen. Triclabendazole is metabolized in the liver, largely by CYP 1A2 and 2C19 and it is theoretically susceptible to drug-drug interactions. Even with repeated dosing, there have been no reports of serious adverse events from triclabendazole therapy.</p>
