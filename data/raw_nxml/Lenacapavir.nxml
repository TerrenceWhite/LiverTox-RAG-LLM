          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Lenacapavir is a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) capsid inhibitor that is used in combination with other antiretroviral agents as therapy of patients with multidrug resistant HIV infection. Lenacapavir has a long duration of action and is available as tablets for oral and in solution for subcutaneous administration, with an extended half-life and can be given every 26 weeks. Lenacapavir is associated with a low rate of transient and usually mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lenacapavir.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Lenacapavir (le nah kah&#x02019; pa veer) is an inhibitor of HIV capsid formation that is active in vitro and in vivo against HIV-1 replication, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor. Lenacapavir inhibits HIV replication in both early and late stages of the replicative cycle and is particularly useful based upon its activity against HIV strains that are resistant to standard antiviral agents. Initial approval of lenacapavir was based upon small trials of therapy of patients with multidrug resistant infections. In these studies, addition of lenacapavir to standard optimized therapy led to decreases in HIV viral levels by at least 0.5 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL. A long acting formulation was created using polyethylene glycol allowing for slow release of the drug from a subcutaneous depot that provides adequate drug levels for viral suppression for 26 weeks. Recommended regimens include a few days of oral followed by subcutaneous (sc) administration of the extended half-life formulation that is given every 26 weeks. Subsequent long term follow up demonstrated maintenance of viral inhibition in more than 80% of recipients. Lenacapavir was approved for use in patients with multidrug resistant HIV infection in 2022. Lenacapavir is available in tablets of 300 mg for initial oral administration and in solution as 463 mg in 1.5 mL single use vials for sc administration under the brand name Sunlenca. Two options are recommended for initiation of therapy. The first option is to start with oral lenacapavir alone in doses of 600 mg on days 1 and 2 and 300 mg on day 8, with sc lenacapavir (927 mg: 2 vials) starting on day 15 which is then continued in the maintenance phase of similar injections every 26 weeks. The second option is to start both oral (600 mg) and sc injections (927 mg) on day 1 with a second oral dose of 600 mg on day 2, followed by the maintenance phase of injections every 26 weeks. Lenacapavir is also being evaluated as preventive therapy in persons at high risk of acquiring HIV infection. In this situation, lenacapavir is administered subcutaneously (927 mg) every 26 weeks without an initial phase using the oral formulation. Lenacapavir is usually described as being well tolerated, side effects being uncommon and mild but possibly including nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal distention, headache, and injection site reactions. Antiviral resistance develops in a proportion of patients treated long term. Serious adverse events are rare, although local reactions with nodule formation can lead to discontinuation.</p>

        <sec id="Lenacapavir.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure small, open-label clinical trial, serum aminotransferase elevations occurred in 10% of patients and were above 5 times the ULN in 2 (3%), both of whom also developed jaundice. In both instances, however, other causes of liver injury were identified, one case being attributed to alcohol related hepatitis and the other to &#x0201c;reconstitution syndrome&#x0201d; caused by the restoration of immune reactivity with the successful control of HIV replication. Both patients were continued on lenacapavir and recovered uneventfully. Since its approval and more widescale use, there have been no published reports of liver injury attributed to lenacapavir. One of the shortcomings of a long acting pharmaceutical agent such as lenacapavir is the inability to stop therapy promptly in the event of toxicity or intolerance.</p>
          <p>Finally, the restoration of immune reactivity as a result of adding lenacapavir to an antiretroviral regimen that is not fully effective can result in reconstitution syndrome and flares of chronic viral hepatitis in patients with preexisting chronic hepatitis B or C.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of idiosyncratic clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lenacapavir.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which lenacapavir might cause liver injury is not known. It is metabolized in the liver, largely via CYP3A4, and it is potentially susceptible to drug-drug interactions, inhibitors of CYP3A4 leading to increased levels and, more importantly, inducers of CYP 3A4 causing a decrease in serum concentrations and increase in risk of virologic failure. Lenacapavir itself is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A and can increase serum concentrations of CYP substrates, effects that can persist for up to 9 months after its subcutaneous administration.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lenacapavir.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum aminotransferase elevations are common during lenacapavir therapy but mostly due to underlying, preexisting liver disease or other medications being taken by patients with chronic HIV infection. Routine monitoring of liver tests is not recommended in the product label. If aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) arise, other possible causes of liver injury should be sought and lenacapavir therapy should be interrupted only if levels remain elevated and unexplained. Because it is administered every 26 weeks, interruption of therapy is usually not possible, and full diagnostic evaluation and further follow up is usually available before a decision needs to be made.</p>
