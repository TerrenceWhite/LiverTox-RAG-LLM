          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Sotorasib is a small molecule inhibitor of the KRAS G12C mutant protein which is found in up to 13% of refractory cases of non-small cell lung cancer. Serum aminotransferase elevations are common during therapy with sotorasib, and a proportion of patients develop clinically apparent liver injury that can be severe.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sotorasib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Sotorasib (soe toe ras&#x02019; ib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the KRAS gene product which is a frequently mutated oncogene found in several forms of cancer, most commonly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The KRAS (Kristen rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) G12C mutation produces a constituently produced protein that stimulates excessive cell growth. Sotorasib binds to and inhibits the abnormal KRAS gene product and is a potent inhibitor of cell growth and proliferation in tumor cell lines and experimental tumor models with the KRAS G12C mutation, the first inhibitor of this oncogene protein. In large open label trials, sotorasib was found to induce objective responses in 36% of patients with refractory NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation. Sotorasib was granted accelerated approval in the U.S. in 2019 for adults with NSCLC with documented KRAS G12C mutations. It remains under evaluation for other forms of cancer harboring KRAS G12C mutations. Sotorasib is available in tablets of 120 and 320 mg under the brand name Lumakras. The recommended dose is 960 mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects are common and arise in almost all patients treated with sotorasib and lead to dose modification or discontinuation in approximately one-third of treated patients. Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, anemia, and aminotransferase elevations. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sotorasib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of sotorasib in patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, liver test abnormalities were frequent although usually self-limited and mild. Some degree of ALT elevations arose in 38% of sotorasib treated patients and were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 6% to 7%. In these trials that enrolled approximately 427 patients, sotorasib was discontinued early due to increased AST or ALT in 8% of patients. In addition, a small proportion of patients developed significant hepatotoxicity requiring sotorasib discontinuation and treatment with corticosteroids. The liver test abnormalities had a median onset of 9 weeks after initiation of therapy. While serum aminotransferase elevations were occasionally quite high (5 to 20 times upper limit of normal), there was no accompanying elevations in serum bilirubin and no patient developed clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. The product label for sotorasib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests before, at 3 week intervals during the first 3 months of therapy, and monthly thereafter as clinically indicated.</p>
          <p>Strikingly, the more severe elevations of serum aminotransferase levels during therapy with sotorasib occurred among patients who had recently received checkpoint inhibitor therapy (usually anti-PD-L1) in the 1 to 3 months before starting sotorasib. Furthermore, the elevations tended to respond quickly to corticosteroid therapy and sometimes did not recur when sotorasib was restarted several months later. These findings suggest that the aminotransferase elevations during sotorasib therapy are due to a delayed immune-mediated hepatotoxicity triggered by the previous checkpoint inhibitor therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible but infrequent cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Sotorasib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from sotorasib is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities suggests immune-mediated liver injury. Several retrospective analyses have found that significant ALT and AST elevations arise most frequently in patients who had received checkpoint inhibitor therapy (usually anti-PD-L1) within 3 months of starting sotorasib. Furthermore, the histologic and clinical features of liver injury from sotorasib resemble that of checkpoint inhibitors and a limited course of corticosteroids is often found to be beneficial.</p>
          <p>Sotorasib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce the CYP enzyme reactivity. Because of its known toxicity, drugs that inhibit CYP 3A4 activity should be avoided or the dose of sotorasib adjusted according.</p>

        <sec id="Sotorasib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for sotorasib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests before starting treatment, at 3 week intervals during the first 3 months of treatment and monthly thereafter as clinically indicated. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation of sotorasib therapy and careful monitoring. If serum aminotransferase levels remain high, a limited course of corticosteroids may be appropriate, particularly if there is a history of prior check point inhibitor therapy or accompanying signs of hypersensitivity are present. Furthermore, restarting therapy in a reduced dose can be done with caution and continued monitoring. In patients with jaundice or symptoms of liver injury accompanying the serum aminotransferase elevations, sotorasib should be promptly discontinued. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the antineoplastic, small molecule enzyme and receptor inhibitors, but there is no information on shared adverse event sensitivity of sotorasib with other antineoplastic small molecule inhibitors.</p>
