          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Multiple parenterally administered agents are available as prophylaxis or treatment of acute attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE), including plasma derived and recombinant preparations of the C1-esterase Inhibitor as well as small protein and monoclonal antibody inhibitors of kallikrein and bradykinin activity. While several of these have been linked to transient serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy, the abnormalities are usually mild-to-moderate in severity, transient in duration, and sometimes due to the underlying condition rather than the treatment. None of the agents used to prevent or treat acute attacks of HAE have been convincingly implicated in cases of acute liver injury with symptoms or jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="HAEAgents.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the gene that encodes C1-esterase inhibitor and is marked clinically by intermittent episodes of moderate-to-severe swelling and pain affecting the gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract, skin, hands, feet, face, or larynx. The attacks are intermittent and unpredictable and can be disabling although usually self-limited, lasting hours or a few days. Most critical are attacks of laryngeal edema that can result in airway compromise and fatal respiratory failure. HAE is caused by mutations in the SERPIN-G1 gene that encodes the C1-esterase inhibitor that is important in regulation of kallikrein and release of bradykinin. Elevated bradykinin levels cause an increase in vascular permeability resulting in the swelling and pain of acute attacks. Several medications have been developed for prophylaxis against or treatment of acute attacks (Table), including human plasma derived (Cinryze, Haegarda, Berinert) and recombinant C1-esterase inhibitors (Ruconest). These require parenteral administration and are only partially effective in preventing attacks. Also available are small protein or polypeptide inhibitors of the kallikrein pathway (Kalbitor: ecallantide, and Firazyr: icatibant) and monoclonal antibodies to kallikrein (Takhzyro: lanadelumab). These therapies are all given parenterally either at the time of an acute attack or chronically to prevent attacks. While sometimes associated with serum aminotransferase elevations, the enzyme abnormalities are generally mild-to-moderate in severity, and more likely due to the underlying acute attack or comorbidities associated with HAE and its chronic therapy.</p>
          <p><bold>Berotralstat</bold>, an orally available agent used to prevent acute attacks of HAE, is a small molecule inhibitor of bradykinin and was approved for use in preventing acute attacks of HAE in 2020. It is not considered effective as therapy of acute attacks of HAE. It is described in a separate chapter of LiverTox: <related-object link-type="booklink" source-id="livertox" document-id="Berotralstat" document-type="book-part">Berotralstat</related-object>.</p>
          <p><bold>Danazol</bold> is a weak androgenic steroid that was previously used off-label to decrease HAE attacks, but is now rarely employed.</p>

        <sec id="HAEAgents.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p><bold>Cinryze</bold> is the proprietary name for a human plasma derived preparation of C1-esterase inhibitor that was approved for prevention of acute attacks of HAE in 2008 and remains available as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution in single use vials of 500 IU. The recommended dose for adults and adolescents is 1000 IU intravenously every 3 to 4 days (twice weekly). For children ages 6 to 11 years the dose is 500 IU intravenously every 3 to 4 days. Common adverse events include infusion reactions, headache, nausea and vomiting, rash, and fever. Potentially serious but uncommon adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions, an increased risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, and the potential of viral transmission because the protein is purified from human plasma that might harbor an infectious agent despite screening of the plasma and the purification process. The product label of Cinryze does not mention ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity and controlled trials and observational studies do not mention hepatic adverse events. Since its approval, there have been no published reports of drug induced liver injury attributed to Cinryze.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
          <p><bold>Haegarda</bold> is the proprietary name for a human plasma derived preparation of C1-esterase inhibitor that was approved for prophylaxis of acute attacks of HAE in 2017 and is available as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution in single use vials of 2000 or 3000 IU. The recommended dose for both adults and children 6 years of age and older is 60 IU/kg subcutaneously twice weekly (every 3 to 4 days). Common adverse events include injection site reactions, hypersensitivity, nasopharyngitis, and dizziness. Potentially serious but uncommon adverse events include severe hypersensitivity reactions, increased risk for arterial and venous thromboembolic events, and the potential risk of viral transmission because the protein is purified from human plasma that might harbor infectious agents despite screening of the plasma and the purification process. The product label of Haegarda does not mention ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity and controlled trials and observational studies do not mention hepatic adverse events. Since its approval and more widescale use there have been no published reports of drug induced liver injury attributed to Haegarda. There have been no reports of transmission of viral agents ascribed to Haegarda thus far.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
          <p><bold>Berinert</bold> is the proprietary name for a human plasma derived preparation of C1-esterase inhibitor that was approved for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE in 2009 and is available as a freeze-dried powder for reconstitution in single use vials of 500 IU. The recommended dose for both adults and children is 20 IU/kg body weight intravenously once for each acute attack. Common adverse events include injection site reactions, dysgeusia, headache, and abdominal discomfort. Potentially serious but uncommon adverse events include severe hypersensitivity reactions, increased risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic events, and the potential risk of viral transmission because the protein is purified from human plasma that might harbor an infectious agent despite screening of the plasma and the purification process. The product label of Berinert does not mention ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity, and controlled trials and observational studies do not mention hepatic adverse events. Since its approval and more widescale use there have been no published reports of drug induced liver injury attributed to Berinert. There have been no reports of transmission of viral agents ascribed to Berinert thus far.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
          <p><bold>Ruconest</bold> is the proprietary name for a recombinant, human C1-esterase inhibitor that was approved for treatment of adults and adolescents with acute attacks of HAE in 2014 and is available as a lyophilized powder for reconstitution in single dose vials of 2100 U. The recombinant protein is produced in transgenic rabbits that secrete the protein in milk. The recommended dose is 50 U per kg body weight if less than 84 kg and 4200 U if body weight is 84 kg or greater given as an intravenous infusion upon recognition of an HAE attack. The first dose should be given by a qualified healthcare professional, but patients can be trained in how to self-administer the infusions so that they can be given with the first evidence of an acute attack. Common adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions, headache, nausea and diarrhea. Potentially serious but uncommon adverse events include severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, and an increased risk of arterial and venous thromboembolic events. Subsequent to its approval and more widescale use, there have been no published reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to Ruconest.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
          <p><bold>Kalbitor</bold> is the proprietary name for ecallantide, a 60 amino acid protein inhibitor of plasma kallikrein that was approved for treatment of acute attacks of HAE adults or children 12 years of age or older in 2009 and is available as a solution for subcutaneous injection in single use glass vials of 10 mg/mL. The recommended dose is 30 mg (three 10 mL subcutaneous injections) which can be repeated once within a 24 hour period, if necessary. The usual regimen is a single injection [more than 90%] and few have required more than two injections. Common adverse events of ecallantide therapy include injection site reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headache, nausea, diarrhea, fever, and nasopharyngitis. Rare but potentially severe adverse reactions include severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis for which reason it should be administered only by a healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis. Because ecallantide is a recombinant protein, it is metabolized by proteolytic enzymes to smaller peptides or amino acids and not by hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Hypersensitivity reactions are likely due to non-human source of the recombinant protein. The product label for ecallantide does not mention ALT elevations or hepatotoxicity. Subsequent to the approval of ecallantide, there have been no published reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
          <p><bold>Firazyr</bold> is the proprietary name for icatibant, a synthetic decapeptide inhibitor of the bradykinin B2 receptor that was approved for treatment of adults with acute attacks of HAE in 2011 and is available in solution in prefilled single dose syringes of 30 mg in 3 mL (10 mg/mL). The recommended dose is 30 mg subcutaneously with subsequent injections at least 6 hours apart and no more than 3 injections per day. The usual regimen is a single 30 mg dosage [more than 90%] and few are for more two 30 mg injections. Common adverse events of icatibant therapy include injection site reactions and, less commonly, rash, fever, and dizziness. Icatibant is metabolized by intracellular proteolytic enzymes and does not involve the hepatic cytochrome P450 system. Despite this, elevations in serum aminotransferase levels arose in 4% of patients enrolled in preregistration studies but were usually mild, invariably self-limited in course, not associated with bilirubin elevations, and not requiring dose modification or discontinuation. There were no severe adverse events that were attributed to icatibant therapy. Subsequent to the approval of icatibant in 2011, there have been no published reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
          <p><bold>Takhzyro</bold> is the proprietary name for lanadelumab a human monoclonal antibody to plasma kallikrein that was approved for prophylaxis of acute attacks of HAE in 2018 and is available in solution in a prefilled single dose syringe of 150 mg in 1 mL and 300 mg in 2 mL, as well as in vials of 300 mg in 2 mL. The recommended dose for adults and children above the age of 12 years is 300 mg subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks. The dose for children between 2 and 12 years of age is 150 mg subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks. Common adverse events include injection site reactions, hypersensitivity, nasopharyngitis, headache, rash, diarrhea, myalgia, and dizziness. Potentially serious but uncommon adverse events include severe hypersensitivity reactions. In preregistration trials in HAE, serum aminotransferase elevations arose in 2% of lanadelumab treated subjects vs 0% of placebo recipients. The aminotransferase elevations were transient and asymptomatic and not accompanied by symptoms or jaundice. Since its approval and more widespread use, there have been no reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to lanadelumab. Lanadelumab is described in a separate chapter in LiverTox: <related-object link-type="booklink" source-id="livertox" document-id="Lanadelumab" document-type="book-part">Lanadelumab</related-object>.</p>

          <p>The product labels for the various parenteral therapies of acute attacks of HAE do not recommend monitoring of routine liver tests during therapy, but testing HAE patients before starting long term prophylaxis therapy is appropriate because of the frequency of comorbidities including liver disease in patients with HAE. Rise in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy should trigger evaluation for other possible causes. Persistence of unexplained ALT levels above 5 times the ULN or appearance of symptoms of liver injury or jaundice should lead to at least temporary discontinuation and more careful monitoring.</p>
