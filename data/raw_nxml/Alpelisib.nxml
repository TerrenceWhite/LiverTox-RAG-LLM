          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Alpelisib is an oral selective inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PIK3) which is mutated in several forms of solid tumors and is approved for use in specific forms of advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Serum aminotransferase elevations are common during alpelisib therapy but clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice has not been reported with its use and must be rare, if it occurs at all.</p>

        <sec id="Alpelisib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Alpelisib (al&#x0201d; pe lis&#x02019; ib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the alpha catalytic subunit of phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PIK3CA), an important mediator of cell growth and proliferation. Mutations in PIK3CA are found in several forms of cancer, including breast, ovarian and colorectal carcinoma. These mutations result in dysregulation of cell growth, differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, pathways that are important in the development of cancer. Specific mutations in PIK3CA are found most frequently (~40%) in hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (HER2-) breast cancer. Clinical trials of alpelisib combined with antiestrogens in postmenopausal women with breast cancer demonstrate prolongation of both overall and progression free survival. The increase in overall response rates were found only in patients with PIK3CA mutant forms of cancer, and not in unmutated, wild type forms of PIK3CA. Alpelisib was approved in the United States as therapy in combination with fulvestrant for postmenopausal women or men with advanced or metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer with mutated PIK3CA. Alpelisib is available in tablets of 50, 150 and 200 mg under the brand name Piqray. The recommended dose is 300 mg once daily. Dose reductions to 250 and 200 mg daily are often needed, but lower doses are not recommended. Alpelisib is given in combination with fulvestrant, an anti-estrogen, the recommended dosage being 500 mg given intramuscularly on days 1, 15 and 29 and monthly thereafter. Side effects of combination alpelisib-fulvestrant therapy are common and arise in almost all patients and can include hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite, fatigue, rash, stomatitis, weight loss, and elevations in serum creatinine, lipase and aminotransferase levels. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions, severe cutaneous reactions including DRESS and Stevens Johnson syndrome, pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease, severe diarrhea with dehydration, marked hyperglycemia, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Alpelisib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of alpelisib in patients with cancer, liver test abnormalities were frequent although usually transient, asymptomatic, and mild-to-moderate in severity. Some degree of ALT elevation arose in up to 44% of alpelisib- and fulvestrant-treated patients, but were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in only 3% to 4%. The aminotransferase elevations rarely necessitated dose modifications or interruptions, and only slightly lower rates of enzyme elevations occurred in patients taking fulvestrant without alpelisib. In these trials that enrolled less than 1000 patients, there were several reports of marked serum aminotransferase elevations that led to early discontinuation. However, the nature and clinical features of the liver injury were not provided and there were no cases of clinically apparent liver injury. Skin rashes were also common with alpelisib therapy, and patients are often given prophylactic antihistamines which appear to result in fewer and milder rashes. However, moderate-to-severe rash can occur and some are accompanied by drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic signs (DRESS) syndrome, some degree of liver injury (usually anicteric and asymptomatic) being a part of the manifestations.</p>

        <sec id="Alpelisib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of liver injury from alpelisib is unknown, but with pattern of abnormalities suggests some degree of low level, direct hepatotoxicity. Alpelisib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4 and 2C9, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce the CYP enzyme reactivity.</p>

        <sec id="Alpelisib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) should lead to dose reduction or temporary interruption of alpelisib therapy. In patients with clinically apparent liver injury and jaundice, restarting therapy should be done with caution but with aminotransferase elevations without jaundice or symptoms, cautious reintroduction of therapy can be attempted. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the tyrosine kinase inhibitors but there is no information or shared adverse event sensitivity of alpelisib with other antineoplastic protein kinase inhibitors.</p>
