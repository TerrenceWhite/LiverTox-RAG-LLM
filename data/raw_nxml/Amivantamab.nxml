          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Amivantamab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that inhibits the receptors of both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET) and is used alone or in combination with other antineoplastic agents to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that harbor EGF receptor mutations. Amivantamab when combined with other cancer agents is associated with transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy, but it has not been convincingly linked to episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Amivantamab.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Amivantamab (am&#x0201d; i van&#x02019; ta mab) is a fully human, bispecific monoclonal antibody that targets the receptors of both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (MET). Amivantamab is typically used in combination with lazertinib or other antineoplastic agents to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that harbors EGF receptor mutations. EGF receptors are frequently mutated in lung cancer resulting in excessive activation of the EGF receptor pathway which promotes cell growth and proliferation, and which may also secondarily activate the c-MET pathway. These mutations are often responsible for the drug resistance to conventional EGF receptor inhibitors, such as erlotinib and gefitinib. Amivantamab has activity against wild type EGF receptors as well as potent activity against receptors that harbor the mutant exon 20 insertion, which is found in 9% of patients diagnosed with NSCLC. When used alone, amivantamab was found to increase progression-free survival compared to placebo in patients with advanced NSCLC who harbored receptor exon 20 insertion mutations and were refractory to previous platinum-based chemotherapy. Subsequently, indications were broadened for amivantamab combined with other agents including lazertinib and carboplatin with pemetrexed even as first line therapy of advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGF receptor mutations. Amivantamab was approved for use in the United States in 2021 and is available in solution as 350 mg in 7 mL (50 mg/mL) in single dose vials under the brand name Rybrevant. The recommended dose varies by body weight, timing, and which antineoplastic agents are given in combination, but is generally in the range of 1,000 to 2,100 mg given intravenously once weekly for 4 weeks followed by every 3 weeks until unacceptable intolerance or disease progression arises. Side effects are common with amivantamab combination therapy. Common, mild-to-moderate side effects include rash, nail toxicity, infusion reactions, fatigue, stomatitis, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, edema, musculoskeletal and abdominal pain, paresthesia, and pruritus. Less frequent but potentially severe adverse events include severe infusion-related reactions, interstitial lung disease, venous thromboembolic events, severe skin rash, ocular toxicity and embryo-fetal toxicity. Many of these adverse events are probably due to the kinase inhibitors or cytotoxic agents that are coadministered with amivantamab. Its combination with lazertinib has a boxed warning about thromboembolic events, and routine anticoagulation is recommended for the first 4 months of treatment.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Amivantamab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure, single armed trials of amivantamab in patients with refractory, advanced or metastatic NSCLC, liver test abnormalities were frequent, with elevations in ALT in 34% of 362 participants treated. The elevations were generally mild and self-limited in course. Elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) occurred in only 1.4% and were not accompanied by elevations in serum bilirubin. No patient developed evidence of drug induced liver injury or clinically apparent liver injury. Increases in serum ALT levels led to infrequent dose interruptions but not to drug discontinuations. There was no placebo control used in these studies and the background rate of transient ALT elevations in this patient population, who are often receiving other antineoplastic agents, was not known. In subsequent trials of amivantamab combined with conventional chemotherapeutic agents or with lazertinib, serum ALT or AST elevations were more frequent. In patients on the combination of amivantamab with lazertinib, ALT and AST elevations arose in 65% of subjects and were above 5 times ULN in 7%. However, even those higher enzyme elevations were not accompanied by jaundice or symptoms of acute liver injury and no case was considered to have drug induced liver injury. Since approval and more widespread use of amivantamab, there have been no published case reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to its use. Thus, amivantamab therapy may be accompanied by transient serum aminotransferase elevations but has not been convincingly implicated in instances of clinically significant liver injury.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Amivantamab.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The serum enzyme elevations that arise during amivantamab therapy are probably due to other antineoplastic agents being used or the result of progression of NSCLC or other medical conditions. Amivantamab is a human monoclonal antibody and is metabolized to small oligonucleotides and nucleic acids. It is not metabolized by hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes. On the other hand, the pathways inhibited by amivantamab (EGF and MET signaling) play a complex role in hepatic function, repair, and regeneration, and an &#x0201c;off target&#x0201d; effect of their actions might lead indirectly to hepatic injury. Because amivantamab is given in combination with other potent antineoplastic agents, it is difficult to know whether abnormalities are attributable to the monoclonal antibody or the coadministered potentially cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.</p>

          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for amivantamab does not specifically recommend monitoring of liver tests before or during treatment. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) or any elevations accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should lead to at least temporary cessation of both or at least one of the administered agents. There is no evidence to suggest a cross reactivity in risk for adverse events, hypersensitivity, or hepatic injury between amivantamab and kinase inhibitors or cytotoxic neoplastic agents.</p>
