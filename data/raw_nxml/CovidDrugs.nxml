        <title>OVERVIEW</title>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">In late 2019 a severe outbreak of acute respiratory illness was first identified in Wuhan, China and was shown to be due to a novel coronavirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome associated Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The infection rapidly spread globally, causing severe morbidity and mortality worldwide. Within a year of its recognition as a global pandemic, more than 100 million persons had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more than 2 million had died of the resulting pneumonia and systemic illness, referred to has COVID-19. Antiviral therapies as well as immunomodulatory treatments evolved quickly, and preventive approaches were attempted, including use of convalescent serum, immune globulins, and monoclonal antibodies. Most importantly, innovative vaccines were developed, several of which have been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) in the United States and abroad. Hepatotoxicity has not been a major problem with most agents used in therapy of COVID-19, but instances of acute liver injury have been reported. Confounding the situation, it is also clear that patients with severe COVID-19 often have liver test abnormalities and some may have significant liver injury seemingly caused by the acute coronavirus infection itself.</p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">The therapy of COVID-19 includes oral and parenterally administered agents, antiviral drugs, immunomodulatory medications, anticytokines, monoclonal antibodies and miscellaneous agents. Many of the agents are conventional medications, initially approved for other medical conditions and repurposed to treat COVID-19. Prevention of COVID-19 was initially attempted using public health measures, as well as pre- and post-exposure antiviral therapies but was ultimately more reliably achieved by vaccination. Vaccines effective in preventing COVID-19 were developed rapidly and approved for use by the FDA in the United States under emergency use authorization. Use of convalescent plasma, immune globulins and monoclonal antibodies have also been assessed as means of prevention with promising but only partial efficacy. Most recently, specific, direct-acting antiviral agents have been developed with potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo. These agents were found to be effective if administered soon after onset of infection, most reliably if given with 5 days of onset of symptoms or first identification of infection.</p>
        <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Hepatotoxicity is rare with most medications used to treat COVID-19, but can occur. Most medications are given for a short time only, and the symptoms and signs of the SARS-CoV-2 infection overshadow the mild and transient liver injury that arises with some of the medications used to treat or manage COVID-19. Furthermore, instances of acute hepatitis and bile duct injury and loss have been reported in patients with severe COVID-19 in which medications did not appear to play a role.</p>
        <p>Repurposed drugs that have been applied to treatment of COVID-19 include chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, fluvoxamine colchicine, interferon beta and lopinavir/ritonavir. Despite early enthusiasm and some in vitro and animal model data supporting use of these agents, none of them has been shown to improve symptoms or signs, shorten the duration of illness, prevent complications or decrease mortality. Most of these agents have been implicated in rare cases of drug induced liver disease, but no specific instances of clinically apparent liver injury have been convincingly shown in case reports, case series or clinical trials of these agents being used as therapy of COVID-19.</p>
        <p>Specific antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2 are still being developed. As of the start of 2022, three direct acting antivirals have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) as therapy for COVID-19. All three agents &#x02013; molnupiravir, nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and remdesivir &#x02013; have potent activity against SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture and in animal models of COVID-19. They are particularly potent when administered early after exposure in ameliorating the subsequent severity of infection. In randomized controlled trials in humans with early COVID-19 who were at high risk for complications, all three agents were found to reduce the rate of subsequent hospitalization and death. While remdesivir requires intravenous administration (once daily for 3 days), molnupiravir and Paxlovid are administered orally (typically twice daily for 5 days). Only remdesivir has received full approval for use in COVID-19 infection, but the indication for this approval was for use in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and need for supplementary oxygen. In one large, randomized controlled trial, remdesivir was reported to shorten the time to recovery in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia needing supplementary oxygen. This effect was not confirmed in other controlled trials, but remdesivir has become the standard of care in patients with life-threatening COVID-19.</p>
        <p>Analysis of cytokines and inflammatory pathways during severe COVID-19 pneumonia suggested that robust dysregulated inflammatory responses play a role in disease severity and organ failure. Accordingly, anticytokines have been assessed as adjunctive therapies for the hyperinflammatory features of severe COVID-19 infection. Agents that have shown promising effects for treating COVID-19 infection include IL-6 inhibitors such as sarilumab and tocilizumab and small molecule inhibitors of JAK kinases, including baricitinib and ruxolitinib. Some of these agents have received provisional emergency use authorization. Interestingly, dexamethasone has been assessed in clinical trials and shown convincing evidence of reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and respiratory failure. Its usefulness in patients with earlier or less severe pulmonary compromise is not clear, and it is now recommended only for patients requiring high-flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation or in high risk patients with hypoxia requiring supplemental inhaled oxygen.</p>
        <p>Several human monoclonal antibodies directed to the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been developed and assessed in patients with COVID-19 infection. EUA has been granted to four such biologic products which are now recommended to be used in combination, namely, bamlanivimab with etesevimab and casirivimab with imdevimab, in nonhospitalized patients with early stages of COVID-19 infection. These monoclonal antibodies have also been used in attempts to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection after known exposure (postexposure prophylaxis) and appear to be partially effective.</p>
        <p>Most trials of therapy of COVID-19 infection employ an ordinal scale to assess clinical status and improvement (Table below). This scale is also used to define sequential phases of the clinical syndrome and to define indications for when to start specific therapies. Whether the patient is at high risk for complications (older age, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arterial hypertension, immune suppression, other co-morbidities) is also used to recommend therapy, usually to expand indications. Thus, monoclonal antibodies are recommended for patients in categories 1 and 2, particularly if they are in a high risk group. Remdesivir appears to have its main effects in patients in categories 5 and 6 but is also recommended in patients in category 4 who are at high risk of complications. The combination of remdesivir and baricitinib has been found to have significant benefit largely in patients in categories 5 to 7 and while dexamethasone demonstrated its major effects in patients in categories 6 and 7.</p>

          <p>Research on prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is proceeding rapidly and new studies are published weekly making it difficult to provide up-to-date information and recommendations. Data on hepatotoxicity of the agents used to treated COVID-19, however, are sparse, and the hepatic adverse events during therapies are not always well described and not always clearly attributable to a specific medication. The typical patient with severe COVID-19 pneumonia will be receiving a dozen or more medications, a proportion of which are capable of causing hepatotoxicity. Nevertheless, serious hepatic adverse reactions or deaths from hepatic failure are rare except as a part of end-stage, multiorgan failure. Even in patients with preexisting liver disease, fatalities from COVID-19 are usually due to respiratory rather than hepatic failure.</p>
          <p>Perhaps most important in control and management of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vaccination, and several highly effective and safe vaccines have been developed and are now being used widely. In the United States, three COVID-19 vaccines have been granted emergency use authorization for use and a fourth may be approved shortly. Other vaccines have been produced in Russia and in China have been found effective in trials in those countries and are now being widely used abroad.</p>
          <p>COVID-19 vaccines have not been definitively linked to instances of liver injury, either in the form of serum enzyme elevations or clinically apparent liver injury. Recently, however, two somewhat distinctive syndromes with liver injury have been described. The first syndrome is referred to as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) and has been identified in rare subjects (~1 per million overall) receiving adenoviral vector-based vaccines. This syndrome arises 1 to 3 weeks after initial vaccination, most frequently in younger subjects (less than 55 years of age) and in women, and is characterized clinically by thrombotic events in unusual sites (brain and splanchnic venous system) accompanied by thrombocytopenia and antibodies to platelet factor-4. Thrombotic events can include portal vein thrombosis and be associated with liver test abnormalities. The second syndrome is an acute hepatitis arising within 1 to 4 weeks of vaccination (usually the initial dose). Patients present with fatigue, nausea, dark urine and jaundice and laboratory tests generally show features suggestive of acute hepatitis with autoimmune features, such as autoantibodies (ANA, SMA) and elevations in serum immunoglobin levels. Liver histology generally shows a lobular hepatitis and portal inflammation with lymphocytes and plasma cells, features typical of autoimmune hepatitis. Importantly, the liver injury responds promptly to corticosteroid therapy. In most cases, the disease resolves and the corticosteroids can eventually be discontinued without recurrence of injury. The cause of this syndrome remains unknown, and one possibility is that the autoimmune hepatitis is spontaneous, coincidental and unrelated to vaccination.</p>
          <p>Background information and discussion of hepatotoxicity of the major agents used to prevent and treat COVID-19 are provided in individual chapters. It is important to stress that LiverTox focuses on the hepatic effects of drugs and biologics and should not be used as guidance for use of these agents, such as for specific indications, drug dosing and regimens.</p>
