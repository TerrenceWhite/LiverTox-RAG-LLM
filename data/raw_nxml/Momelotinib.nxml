          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Momelotinib is a small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of intermediate or high risk, primary or secondary myelofibrosis. Momelotinib is associated with transient and usually mild elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy and has also been linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury including reactivation of hepatitis B.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Momelotinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Momelotinib (moe&#x0201d; me, loe&#x02019; ti nib) is an orally available, small molecular inhibitor of Janus kinase subtype 1 and 2 (JAK1/2) including mutant JAK2<sup>V617F</sup> and is used to treat resistant forms of myelofibrosis including secondary forms related to polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Myelofibrosis is a cancerous or pre-cancerous condition of the bone marrow that results in progressive bone marrow failure with enlargement of the spleen, anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. JAK1 and JAK2 are non-receptor tyrosine kinases that are critical components of pathways that lead to production and secretion of hematologic growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. These pathways are important in hematologic cell differentiation and proliferation, in cytokine-production, and inflammatory reactions. Mutations in JAK genes are frequent in patients with myelofibrosis including JAK2<sup>V617F</sup> which is found in more than 90% of patients with polycythemia vera and at least 50% of those with essential thrombocythemia. Inhibition of these kinases can result in antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in malignant cells. Momelotinib has been shown to improve symptoms, cause shrinkage of spleen size, and decrease circulating cytokine levels in patients with myelofibrosis independent of the known presence of Janus kinase mutations. Momelotinib was approved for use in the United States in 2023 for therapy of intermediate and high risk primary or secondary myelofibrosis with anemia. Momelotinib is available in capsules of 100, 150, and 200 mg under the brand name Ojjaara. The recommended initial dose is 200 mg once daily. Dose adjustments for hepatic dysfunction and for adverse reactions are recommended. Common side effects include myelosuppression, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, diarrhea, bruising, dizziness, peripheral neuropathy, dyspnea, headache and fatigue. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include risk of infections including reactivation of viruses, peripheral neuropathy, severe thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. All small molecule JAK inhibitors have safety labeling for increased risk of major cardiovascular adverse events, increased mortality, venous and arterial thromboses, secondary malignancies, and increased risk of infection.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Momelotinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the published preregistration clinical trials of momelotinib, rates of serum ALT or AST elevations ranged from 21% to 31% and were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in 0.5% to 2.0%, and above 20 times ULN in 0.5%. Two of 448 momelotinib treated patients evaluated in the safety cohort developed clinically apparent, but self-limiting liver injury with jaundice. A third patient developed liver injury with jaundice that appeared to be due to reactivation of hepatitis B. The liver injury was typically hepatocellular without immune allergic or autoimmune features, arising after 2 to 4 months of therapy, and resolving soon after drug discontinuation. Peak ALT elevations ranged from 308 to 1178 U/L and peak bilirubin from 2.3 to 7.0 mg/dL. There were no deaths from hepatic failure. Since its approval and more widespread clinical use, there have been no further reports of serum enzyme or bilirubin elevations or instances of clinically apparent liver injury, but it has been available for a limited time only.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible cause of clinically apparent liver injury including reactivation of hepatitis B).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Momelotinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Momelotinib therapy has been clearly linked to serum enzyme elevations and to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury. It is metabolized in the liver, and liver injury may be due to its metabolism to an immunogenic or toxic intermediate. Momelotinib is a weak inducer of CYP 2B6 and competes for hepatic uptake for the organic anion transporting polypeptide and hepatocyte secretion for the breast cancer resistance protein and thus may have significant drug-drug interactions. Because of its effects on intracellular signaling involved in immune responses, momelotinib (and other JAK inhibitors) may be capable of increasing hepatitis B viral replication, which can result in clinically apparent reactivation of hepatitis B.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Momelotinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Momelotinib has been clearly linked to serum aminotransferase elevations and significant liver injury. For this reason, routine monitoring of liver tests is recommended in the product label every month for six months, and &#x0201c;as needed&#x0201d; thereafter. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times ULN should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation until they fall into the normal or near normal range, or another cause for the elevations is found. ALT or AST elevations above 20 times ULN or any elevations accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should lead to discontinuation. Because of the possibility of reactivation of hepatitis B, it is appropriate to screen patients for hepatitis B markers before starting momelotinib and, if HBsAg or anti-HBc are present, providing antiviral prophylaxis or monitoring for reactivation during therapy. There does not appear to be cross reactivity in risk for hepatic injury among the various JAK kinase inhibitors, but few instances have been studied.</p>
