          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Afamelanotide is a melanocortin-1 receptor agonist that stimulates melanin production in the skin and is used to decrease pain and itching from light exposure in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria. Afamelanotide has not been linked to serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy nor to instances of idiosyncratic acute liver injury with symptoms and jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Afamelanotide.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Afamelanotide (a fa mel&#x0201d; ano tide&#x02019;) is a melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) agonist that stimulates melanin production in the skin and is used to decrease pain and itching from light exposure in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) or X-linked protoporphyria (XLPP). EPP and XLPP are rare genetic diseases of heme synthesis that typically present in childhood with severe and painful photosensitivity. Although the clinical phenotypes of EPP and XLPP are closely similar, the underlying genetic and enzymatic defects are different. The cause of EPP, which accounts for 90% to 95% of clinical cases, is a deficiency in ferrochelatase, an enzyme that adds iron to protoporphyrin to create heme, which is the final step in heme synthesis. The cause of XLPP is a gain-of-function mutation in the erythroid form of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, which leads to overproduction of protoporphyrin (PP) beyond the capacity of developing red blood cells to convert the PP into heme and hemoglobin. As a result, protoporphyrin accumulates in red blood cells, plasma, and other tissues, including skin and liver. When exposed to light, protoporphyrin is activated and emits fluorescent light that, in turn, produces singlet oxygen, which initiates a cascade of free radical reactions that cause pain, edema, and inflammation, leading to phototoxic reactions. PP is hydrophobic and is not excreted into the urine, but rather must be taken up by hepatocytes and secreted into the bile. Excess PP can accumulate in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes and cause liver cell injury, sometimes with inflammation and fibrosis, a condition that has been called protoporphyric hepatopathy, which is severe in 2% to 3% of patients. Patients with EPP/XLPP also have an increased risk of pigmented gallstones, comprised chiefly of PP, and need for cholecystectomies. Persons with EPP/XLPP learn to avoid light exposure, which triggers not only pain, but also itching, redness and edema. They learn to avoid sunlight, remain indoors, and when outside to wear protective clothes, hats, gloves, and even masks. Afamelanotide is a modified amino acid analogue of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone that binds to the MC1-R and increases the synthesis of melanin which darkens the skin and helps to absorb, scatter and quench the light that activates the excess protoporphyrin. Pilot studies followed by small randomized controlled trials demonstrated that afamelanotide treatment decreased the symptoms of photosensitivity, allowing patients to have more, but still limited, periods of light exposure. Prospective studies demonstrated an improvement in quality of life, employment, and activities of daily living in persons with EPP/XLPP treated with afamelanotide. Afamelanotide was approved in the United States in 2019 under the brand name Scenesse. Current indications are to increase pain-free light exposure in adults with a history of phototoxic reactions from EPP. The safety and efficacy of afamelanotide have not been proven in children, in whom it has been used off-label. Afamelanotide is available as injectable implants of 16 mg under the brand name Scenesse. The recommended regimen is a subcutaneous implant every 2 months. Afamelanotide is generally well tolerated but side effects can include injection site reactions, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, headache, and somnolence. Rare but potentially serious adverse events include melanocyte nevi and infections.</p>

        <sec id="Afamelanotide.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria are rare genetic diseases, and the pivotal trials of afamelanotide were conducted in a limited number of patients, so the full spectrum of hepatotoxicity may not be fully known. Furthermore, a proportion of untreated persons with EPP/XLPP have liver disease with mild, fluctuating elevations of serum aminotransferase levels; indeed, 2% to 5% develop significant liver disease with cholestatic features and cirrhosis, some of which may be due to gallstones which are common in patients with EPP/XLPP and others due to alcohol or other underlying liver diseases. Against this background, the clinical studies of afamelanotide were accompanied by minor serum enzyme elevations, but in rates that were similar to those receiving placebo and none reaching levels considered indicative of drug induced liver injury. In the three prospective placebo-controlled trials of afamelanotide in EPP/XLPP, there were no episodes of clinically apparent liver injury that arose during therapy, but a few patients developed evidence of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, or complications of gallstones during follow up. These episodes arose long after afamelanotide was stopped and were considered due to the underlying liver disease or concurrent excessive alcohol use. Indeed, afamelanotide treatment is associated with slight decreases in protoporphyrin levels and may ameliorate the course of the EPP/XLPP-associated chronic liver injury. Since, its approval and more widescale use, there have been no reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to afamelanotide.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Afamelanotide.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The reasons why afamelanotide might cause liver injury are not clear. It is a small, modified polypeptide that mimics melanocyte stimulating hormone. After uptake, it is metabolized intracellularly by proteases to its component amino acids by many cells. Allergic reactions and antibodies to afamelanotide are uncommon and it is not a substrate for hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Afamelanotide.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Afamelanotide has not been linked to liver injury, and monitoring of liver enzymes is not recommended during treatment. However, persons with EPP/XLPP are at an increased risk for developing liver disease and gallstones due to accumulation of toxic protoporphyrin for which reason screening for liver disease and ongoing monitoring is warranted.</p>
