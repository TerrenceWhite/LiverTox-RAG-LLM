          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Leniolisib is an orally administered kinase inhibitor that is used to treat adults and children 12 years of age or older with Activated Phosphoinositide-3-kinase-delta Syndrome (APDS), an extremely rare, inherited immunodeficiency disease. Leniolisib has had very limited clinical use but has not been reported to cause elevations in liver enzymes and has not been linked to episodes of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Leniolisib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Leniolisib (len&#x0201d; i oh lis&#x02019; ib) is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta (PI3K&#x003b4;) and is used to treat patients with APDS, an extremely rare, inherited form of immunodeficiency that is estimated to affect fewer than 1000 persons worldwide. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition and exists in two forms: APDS1 due to a gain-of-function mutation in p110&#x003b4; in the catalytic site of PIK3 and ADPS2 due to a loss-of-function mutation in p85 in the regulatory subunit. Both mutations result in hyperactivity of the mTOR/AKT signaling pathway which causes dysregulation of B and T cell functions and subset numbers. The disease typically presents in infancy and childhood with frequent sinopulmonary bacterial infections accompanied by lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and gastrointestinal involvement. Autoimmune phenomena often arise during middle childhood and lymphomas in adulthood. There has been no established, effective therapy for APDS besides treatment of the complications and off-label use of corticosteroids, mTOR inhibitors, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation which has variable results. Leniolisib was the first drug developed for APDS, and in a small, 12-week randomized placebo controlled trial, it was found to improve na&#x000ef;ve B cell numbers and function and lead to decrease in lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Further improvements in symptoms and signs were found with long term therapy. Leniolisib was approved as therapy for adults and children 12 years of age or older (and weight above 45 Kg) in 2023. Leniolisib is available in tablets of 70 mg under the brand name Joenja. The recommended dose is 70 mg twice daily. Therapy is generally well tolerated, but reported adverse events include sinusitis, atopic dermatitis, fatigue, diarrhea, fever, back and neck pain, and alopecia, many of which symptoms may be partially due to the underlying immune deficiency. Laboratory abnormalities include decrease in neutrophils, which are rarely to levels of concern. Severe adverse events are those due to the underlying disease and include severe bacterial infections and chronic viral infections.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Leniolisib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of leniolisib in patients with APDS, ALT elevations were rarely described, and there were no reports of hepatic adverse events or discontinuations because of abnormal liver tests. Intermittent elevations in liver enzymes are not uncommon in patients with untreated APDS due to bacterial, viral and opportunistic infections. Since its approval in the United States, there have been no reported cases of clinically apparent liver injury associated with leniolisib therapy, but the drug has had very limited clinical use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Leniolisib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from leniolisib is unknown. Leniolisib is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, predominantly by CYP 3A4 and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with inducers or inhibitors of CYP 3A4 and may affect levels of drugs that are substrates of this drug metabolizing enzyme.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Leniolisib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for leniolisib does not recommend routine monitoring of liver laboratory tests during therapy. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if detected) should lead to a search for alternative causes of liver enzyme elevations and, if none are found, to dose reduction or temporary cessation of treatment with careful monitoring. Cross sensitivity to liver injury has not been described with the other medications used off label to treat APDS.</p>
