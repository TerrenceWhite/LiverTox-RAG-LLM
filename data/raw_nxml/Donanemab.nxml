          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Donanemab is a humanized monoclonal antibody to aggregated amyloid &#x003b2; which has been approved for use in Alzheimer disease with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Donanemab is associated with a minimal rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Donanemab.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Donanemab (doe nan&#x02019; e mab) is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody directed against insoluble N-truncated pyroglutamate amyloid &#x003b2; which was developed as therapy for Alzheimer disease, based upon the theory that the dementia and neurological decline in Alzheimer disease is caused by accumulation of amyloid &#x003b2; oligomers and fibrils in the frontal lobes of the brain. Studies in animal models and in humans demonstrated that the monoclonal antibody causes a decrease in amyloid &#x003b2; plaque accumulation as shown by advanced imaging techniques. Donanemab was evaluated in large, randomized double-blind controlled trials in more than 1700 patients with symptomatic, early stages of Alzheimer disease and evidence of amyloid &#x003b2; plaques accumulation. Therapy was associated with a statistically significant but modest decrease in the rate of decline in dementia rating scales, but did not stop the decline or reverse the cognitive impairment. Analysis of subgroups indicated that donanemab was most effective in slowing decline in patients with lesser amounts of amyloid plaques at baseline. In 2024, donanemab was approved as therapy of patients with Alzheimer disease with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and documented amyloid plaque pathology by imaging. Donanemab is available in single dose vials of 350 mg in 20 mL (17.5 mg/mL) under the brand name Kisunla. The recommended dose is 700 mg administered intravenously (over 30 minutes) every 4 weeks for 3 doses, followed by 1400 mg every 4 weeks with regularly scheduled evaluations for efficacy and safety. Therapy can be discontinued if imagining indicates minimal or no amyloid plaques remaining. Common side effects include infusion reactions, headache, falls, and amyloid related imaging abnormalities such as edema, hemorrhage, and hemosiderin deposition. Uncommon, potentially severe adverse reactions include hypersensitivity reactions.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Donanemab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Serum aminotransferase elevations were infrequent in the controlled trials of donanemab in Alzheimer disease and no more frequent than with placebo treatment. The elevations were transient, asymptomatic, and mild-to-moderate in severity (1 to 3 times upper limit of normal). In the preregistration trials there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury or severe hepatic adverse events attributed to donanemab. Clinical use outside of randomized controlled trials has been limited.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent acute liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Donanemab.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The possible mechanisms by which donanemab might cause liver injury are unclear. Monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulins are generally taken up and metabolized intracellularly to short peptides and amino acids. There is no evidence to suggest that inhibition of amyloid &#x003b2; accumulation or increase in its clearance would trigger liver injury or autoimmune liver conditions.</p>
