          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Avacopan is an orally available, complement factor 5a receptor antagonist that is used to treat adults with severe antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody-associated vasculitis.

        <sec id="Avacopan.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Avacopan (av&#x0201d; a koe&#x02019; pan) is an orally available, small molecule antagonist of the complement factor 5a receptor that is used to treat adults with severe vasculitis associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA). The two major forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA; formerly known as Wegener&#x02019;s granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). Both forms are considered autoimmune disorders and affect multiple organs, most commonly the kidneys and respiratory tract with damage to the small and medium sized arteries. ANCA-associated vasculitis is associated with activation of alternative complement pathways and activation of C5a on neutrophils, leading to inflammation and vascular cell injury. Inhibition of this complement pathway by avacopan has been shown to decrease both the frequency and the severity of the symptoms and signs of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Avacopan was approved for use in the United States in 2021, and current indications are for treatment of adults with severe ANCA-positive-associated vasculitis either in the form of granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis. Avacopan is given in combination with standard therapies of these conditions including corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Avacopan is available in capsules of 10 mg under the brand name Tavneos. The recommended dose is 30 mg twice daily. Avacopan is a substrate of CYP 3A4 and is sensitive to its induction and inhibition. Contraindications to avacopan include cirrhosis and concurrent use of CYP 3A4 inhibitors (such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, and ritonavir). Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, headache, dizziness, paresthesia, and rash. Uncommon, but potentially severe, adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions (such as angioedema), liver injury, renal injury, reactivation of hepatitis B, and infections.</p>

        <sec id="Avacopan.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In a preregistration randomized controlled trial, serum ALT or AST elevations occurred in 12% of patients taking avacopan vs 13% of placebo recipients. The elevations were largely asymptomatic and transient, resolving promptly after stopping therapy and sometimes despite drug continuation. Nevertheless, some elevations appeared to be related to therapy and arose most frequently during the first few months of treatment. Serious hepatic adverse events with aminotransferase elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal occurred in 9 avacopan-treated (5.4%) vs 6 (3.6%) receiving a tapering regimen of corticosteroids without avacopan. Four of the 9 were considered probable or highly likely drug induced liver injury. Because patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis frequently receive multiple agents capable of causing liver injury (such as cyclophosphamide, rituximab, sulfamethoxazole), it is not always possible to incriminate avacopan definitively as the cause. The aminotransferase abnormalities resolved in all 9 patients once avacopan was discontinued. Bilirubin elevations were rare and there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice in preregistration clinical studies. Because of the aminotransferase elevations, a warning about drug induced liver injury was put in the product label, and monitoring liver tests before and monthly for 6 months after starting therapy was recommended. Since approval of avacopan and its more widescale use, several fairly severe cases of cholestatic hepatitis with jaundice have been reported, mostly from Japan. The latency to onset was typically 4 weeks and the enzyme pattern was cholestatic with or without accompanying immune allergic or autoimmune features.</p>
          <p>Avacopan is an immunosuppressive agent and has the potential of causing reactivation of latent viral infections including hepatitis B. In pooled results from 239 patients in preregistration studies of avacopan, hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation occurred in two. However, both patients received other therapies capable of inducing HBV reactivation (cyclophosphamide, rituximab, corticosteroids), and minimal details of the 2 cases were provided. Nevertheless, patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis in whom therapy is planned should be screened for evidence of ongoing or previous HBV infection with tests for HBsAg and anti-HBc. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis using an oral antiviral agent with potent activity against HBV (tenofovir or entecavir) during therapy. Patients with anti-HBc without HBsAg might be monitored during therapy for evidence of viral reactivation and treated if HBV DNA or HBsAg become detected. Such patients might also benefit from HBV vaccination to boost anti-HBs titers before starting therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: C (probable rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>

        <sec id="Avacopan.Mechanism_of_Liver_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Liver Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which avacopan causes liver injury is unclear, but it is likely idiosyncratic and immune mediated. Avacopan is metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP 3A4 and inhibitors of this isoenzyme (such as itraconazole, cimetidine and ciprofloxacin) can result in higher drug levels and possibly increased rate of adverse events.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Avacopan.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for avacopan has a warning about drug induced liver injury and recommends assessing symptoms and laboratory features of liver disease before starting therapy and monitoring routine liver tests monthly for the first 6 months of therapy and thereafter if signs of symptoms of liver injury arise. Avacopan should be discontinued if ALT or AST levels rise to above 5 times ULN or above 3 times ULN if symptoms or jaundice are present. Patients found to have serum aminotransferase elevations should be followed more carefully until they resolve. Avacopan is not recommended for persons with cirrhosis or active or uncontrolled liver disease and should be used with caution in those with liver test abnormalities at baseline.</p>
