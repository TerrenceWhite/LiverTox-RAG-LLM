          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Setmelanotide is a melanocortin 4 receptor agonist that is used for chronic weight management for adults and children with rare genetic forms obesity due to gene defects in the melanocortin pathway. Setmelanotide therapy has not been associated serum aminotransferase or bilirubin elevations or to instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Setmelanotide.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Setmelanotide (set&#x0201d; me lan&#x02019; oh tide) is an agonist of the melanocortin 4 (MC4) receptor used in the management of children 6 years or older and adults with obesity due to genetic abnormalities in the hypothalamic leptin-melanocortin pathway. Setmelanotide is a small peptide analogue of melanocyte stimulating hormone with preference for the melanocortin-4 receptor, which plays a role in regulation of hunger, satiety, and energy expenditure. These genetic forms of obesity are very rare and include pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 (PCSK1), and leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiencies. These conditions generally present in infancy or childhood with extreme hyperphagia and severe obesity. In small open label clinical trials in these conditions, setmelanotide led to weight loss in most patients, which was usually accompanied by improvements in metabolic features such as lipid and fasting glucose levels. Setmelanotide was approved in the United States in 2020 as therapy for children and adults with obesity due to suspected deficiency of POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR. Indications were expanded in 2023 to include children and adults with obesity due to Bardet-Biedl syndrome. It is not effective in or indicated for typical (polygenic) obesity. Setmelanotide is available in multiple dose vials of 10 mg in 1 mL. The recommended starting dose in adults is 2 mg injected subcutaneously once daily for 2 weeks with increases (to 3 mg) or decreases (to 1 mg) in dose based upon tolerance and efficacy. For children below the age of 12 years, the starting dose is 1 mg with similar titration after 2 weeks. Common adverse events include injection site reactions, skin hyperpigmentation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, back pain, fatigue, depression, and spontaneous penile erection. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions, disturbances of sexual arousal, depression and suicidal ideation, marked skin pigmentation, and darkening of preexisting skin nevi. Solutions of setmelanotide also contain benzyl alcohol as a preservative which can cause serious and fatal adverse reactions in low birth rate infants.</p>

        <sec id="Setmelanotide.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the small open label clinical trials of setmelanotide for genetic forms of obesity, there were no reports of abnormalities of serum aminotransferase or bilirubin levels. One patient developed cholecystitis, but it was considered unrelated to therapy. Since its approval and clinical use, there have been no published cases of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to setmelanotide therapy, but elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy have been described. Thus, setmelanotide therapy has not been linked to clinically apparent liver injury, but the total clinical experience with its use is limited.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Setmelanotide.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Setmelanotide is an 8 amino acid cyclic peptide analogue of alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone and has preference for the MC4 receptor. Partial engagement of the MC1 receptor may account for its side effects of hyperpigmentation and skin darkening. It is metabolized in many tissues intracellularly by proteases into smaller peptides and amino acids and has no effect on hepatic microsomal enzymes.</p>
