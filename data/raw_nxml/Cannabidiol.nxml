          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p content-type="pubmed-excerpt">Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa (marijuana), one of more than 80 cannabinoids identified in the plant, and the second most common constituent after &#x00394;<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component. Cannabidiol is available as an FDA approved prescription medication (Epidiolex) used in moderately high doses for severe forms of epilepsy, but it is also widely available as over-the-counter CBD oils, gummies, topical creams or vaping solutions. High daily doses of cannabidiol are associated with frequent serum enzyme elevations during therapy, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. The lower doses of cannabidiol found typically in over-the-counter CBD products are generally well tolerated without evidence of liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Cannabidiol.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Cannabidiol (kan" a bi dye' ol) is a natural cannabinoid, the second most common component in Cannabis sativa (marijuana). Unlike the most abundant cannabinoid, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, cannabidiol has minimal psychoactive properties and may actually decrease the risk of psychotic symptoms and impaired cognition after cannabis use. The mechanism of action of cannabidiol is unknown, but it may be a partial agonist of cannabinoid receptors. Cannabidiol in moderately high doses was found to reduce the frequency of seizures in treatment-resistant epilepsy, particularly in patients with Lennox-Gastaut or Dravet syndrome, two rare but severe childhood onset forms of epilepsy. Cannabidiol was approved for use in the United States in 2018. Current indications are limited to treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut or Dravet syndrome in adults and in children above the age of two. Cannabidiol is available as an oral solution of 100 mg/mL under the brand name Epidiolex. The typical dose is 2.5 mg/kg twice daily, which can be increased based upon tolerance and effect to 5 mg/kg twice daily and to a maximum of 10 mg/kg twice daily. The dose should be reduced in patients with preexisting hepatic impairment. Side effects are mostly dose related and can include fatigue, somnolence, dizziness, sleep disturbance, insomnia, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, infections and rash. Rare, but potentially severe side effects include marked sedation and somnolence, suicidal behavior and ideation and hypersensitivity reactions. Cannabidiol is generally used in combination with other anticonvulsants and is prone to drug-drug interactions that may affect drug levels and side effects of those agents, particularly valproate and clobazam.</p>
          <p>Cannabidiol as found in over-the-counter products such as CBD oil, gummies or vaping solutions is largely unregulated and often of uncertain concentration and purity. Cannabidiol can be derived from hemp, a Cannabis sativa species with low levels of THC, typically &#x0003c;0.3%, compared to 15% in marijuana. Various forms of cannabidiol have been marketed as having analgesic, antiinflammatory, anxiolytic, antipsychotic and antiarthritic effects, but none of these have been definitely proven in prospective, properly designed studies. Furthermore, the concentration of CBD in most products is not known and varies widely as do low or trace amounts of THC and other contaminants. As a consequence, the purported activities of CBD may actually be effects of THC, accounting for the anecdotal reports of its effects on pain, anxiety, and sleep. The concentration of CBD in these nonprescription forms has generally been less than those in the FDA approved form used in epilepsy (Epidiolex) and daily doses are in the range of 25 to 300 mg daily. Prospective studies of CBD in daily doses of less than 400 mg have generally found few beneficial effects, but also few adverse events except for mild somnolence and dizziness.</p>

        <sec id="Cannabidiol.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In prelicensure studies, serum aminotransferase elevations arose during cannabidiol therapy for epilepsy in 34% to 47% of patients compared to 18% of controls who were receiving other anticonvulsant medications. Elevations above 3 times ULN occurred in 13% of cannabidiol treated compared to 1% on placebo. ALT and AST elevations were more frequent with higher doses and were particularly common (and sometimes delayed) in patients who were receiving valproate and clobazam. The aminotransferase elevations typically arose within the first two months of treatment and were transient, mild-to-moderate in severity, and not associated with symptoms or jaundice. There have been no convincing reports of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice attributable to prescription forms of cannabidiol, but it has had very limited general use.</p>
          <p>There have been few studies of liver test abnormalities during therapy with lower doses of CBD or with commercially available, over-the-counter CBD products. In doses between 200 and 400 mg daily, mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations have occasionally been reported, but there have been no reports of clinically apparent liver injury. Furthermore, liver injury arising in persons taking supplements with CBD must also consider the possibility of contaminants in the products or other herbal and dietary supplement use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury, particularly with high doses).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cannabidiol.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations during cannabidiol therapy in doses used to treat epilepsy is not known, but may represent direct toxicity and be due to the molecule itself or to the production of a toxic intermediate in its metabolism. Cannabidiol is metabolized by the liver in large part by CYP 3A4 and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that induce or inhibit CYP 3A4 activity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Cannabidiol.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>High dose cannabidiol therapy can be associated with serum ALT and AST elevations that generally arise within the first 2 months of treatment and are mild-to-moderate in severity. The frequency of elevations is dose related and more frequent when given in combination with valproate and clobazam. The elevations, however, are generally asymptomatic, self-limited in course and not associated with jaundice. Nevertheless, routine monitoring of liver tests is recommended before starting and at 1, 3 and 6 months during treatment as well as periodically thereafter, particularly in patients who are also receiving valproate. Cannabidiol should be discontinued if there are ALT elevations accompanied by symptoms of jaundice or if the levels rise and persist at more than 5 times ULN.</p>
