          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Adagrasib is a small molecule inhibitor of the KRAS G12C mutant protein which is found in up to 13% of refractory cases of non-small cell lung cancer. Serum aminotransferase elevations are common during therapy with adagrasib, and a proportion of patients develop clinically apparent liver injury that can be severe.</p>

        <sec id="Adagrasib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Adagrasib (a&#x0201d; dah gras&#x02019; ib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the KRAS gene product that is a frequently mutated oncogene found in several forms of cancer, most commonly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The KRAS (Kristen rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) G12C mutation produces a constituently active protein receptor (a member of the RAS GTPase family) that stimulates excessive cell growth. Adagrasib binds to and locks the abnormal receptor into an inactive conformation, thereby inhibiting cell growth and proliferation in tumor cell lines and experimental tumor models with the KRAS G12C mutation. In large open label trials, adagrasib was found to induce objective responses in 43% of patients with refractory NSCLC harboring the KRAS G12C mutation. Adagrasib was granted accelerated approval in the United States in 2022 for adults with NSCLC with documented KRAS G12C mutations, the second small molecule inhibitor approved for this indication (the first being sotorasib). Adagrasib remains under evaluation for other forms of cancer harboring KRAS G12C mutations. Adagrasib is available in tablets of 200 mg under the brand name Krazati. The recommended dose is 600 mg orally twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Side effects of adagrasib are common and arise in almost all treated patients, leading to dose interruptions in 77%, dose modifications in 28%, and permanent discontinuation in 13% of treated patients. Common side effects include diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, cough, dyspnea, edema, leukopenia, anemia, renal impairment, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and aminotransferase elevations. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include gastrointestinal bleeding and obstruction, severe diarrhea or nausea, QTc interval prolongation, hepatotoxicity, and interstitial lung disease.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Adagrasib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of adagrasib in patients with solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, liver test abnormalities were frequent although usually self-limited and mild. Some degree of ALT elevations arose in 28% to 46% of adagrasib treated patients and elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were seen in 5% to 7%. In these trials that enrolled approximately 366 patients, adagrasib was discontinued early due to increased AST or ALT in 8% of patients. In addition, a small proportion of patients developed clinically apparent hepatotoxicity requiring adagrasib discontinuation. The liver test abnormalities had a median onset of 3 weeks after initiation of therapy. While serum aminotransferase elevations were occasionally quite high (5 to 20 times ULN), there were no accompanying elevations in serum bilirubin and no patient developed clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. The product label for adagrasib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests before, at 3 week intervals during the first 3 months of therapy, and thereafter as clinically indicated.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible but infrequent cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Adagrasib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from adagrasib is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities suggests immune-mediated liver injury. Several retrospective analyses have found that significant ALT and AST elevations arise most frequently in patients receiving small molecule inhibitors who had received checkpoint inhibitor therapy (usually anti-PD-L1) within 3 months of starting. Furthermore, the histologic and clinical features of liver injury from tyrosine kinase and other small molecule inhibitors frequently resemble those of checkpoint inhibitors and a limited course of corticosteroids is often found to be beneficial.</p>
          <p>Adagrasib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents. Because of its known toxicity, drugs that inhibit or induce CYP 3A4 activity should be avoided or the dose of adagrasib should be adjusted according. Furthermore, drugs that are substrates of CYP 3A4 may be affected by concurrent treatment with adagrasib and should be avoided.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Adagrasib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for adagrasib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) before starting treatment, monthly for the first 3 months of treatment and as clinically indicated thereafter. The dose of adagrasib should be reduced, held, or permanently discontinued based upon the severity of liver test abnormalities as described in the product label. In patients with jaundice or symptoms of liver injury accompanying the serum aminotransferase elevations, adagrasib should be promptly discontinued and not restarted. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the antineoplastic, small molecule enzyme and receptor inhibitors, but there is no information on shared adverse event sensitivity of adagrasib with other similar small molecule inhibitors such as sotorasib.</p>
