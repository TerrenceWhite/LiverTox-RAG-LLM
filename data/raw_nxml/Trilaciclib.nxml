          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Trilaciclib is an intravenously administered, small molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, that is used to decrease chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression. Serum aminotransferase elevations arise in a small proportion of patients treated with the highest doses of trilaciclib, but episodes of clinically apparent liver injury have not been reported with its use.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Trilaciclib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Trilaciclib (trye&#x0201d; la sye&#x02019; klib) is a first-in-class, short acting inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6, that is used to prevent bone marrow suppression by anticancer therapies. Trilaciclib causes transient G1 cell cycle arrest in hematopoietic cells protecting them against the myelosuppression caused by cytotoxic antineoplastic medications. In animal models and in pilot clinical trials, administration of trilaciclib shortly before starting infusions of cytotoxic antineoplastic agents, lessened the typical decrease in red and white cell counts that occurred with cancer chemotherapy. In several prospective, placebo-controlled randomized trials, infusions of trilaciclib within 4 hours of starting chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, etoposide, and topotecan were associated with fewer episodes of severe neutropenia and neutropenic sepsis but with no change in antineoplastic activity. Trilaciclib was granted accelerated approval for use in chemotherapy in 2021 in the United States for adults with advanced or metastatic small cell lung cancer receiving a platinum-based regimen or a topotecan-based regimen. Trilaciclib is available as a powder for reconstitution in single use vials of 300 mg under the brand name Cosela. The recommended regimen is 240 mg/m<sup>2</sup> infused over 30 minutes within 4 hours of starting chemotherapy for each day of antineoplastic administration (typically days 1 to 3 of 28-day cycles). Trilaciclib is under evaluation in other chemotherapeutic regimens for other advanced cancers. Side effects can include infusion and hypersensitivity reactions as well as fatigue, headache, nausea and vomiting, poor appetite, weight loss, infusion reactions, and thrombophlebitis. Therapy can also cause decreases in serum calcium, phosphate, and potassium, and elevations in creatinine and aminotransferase levels. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include severe hypersensitivity reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>

        <sec id="Trilaciclib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of trilaciclib in patients with advanced cancer receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, serum AST elevations arose in 17% of trilaciclib vs 14% of placebo recipients. The AST elevations were usually self-limited and mild and elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were uncommon, being found in &#x0003c;1% of treated patients. In the randomized controlled trials supporting the approval of trilaciclib, there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury, hepatic failure or deaths from liver injury. Since its approval and more general use, there have been no published reports of hepatoxicity attributed to trilaciclib.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Trilaciclib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of serum aminotransferase elevations from trilaciclib is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities suggests a minor degree of direct toxicity. Trilaciclib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely by CYP 3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP 2C8. Trilaciclib is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce CYP 3A4 activity, which should be avoided while it is being used.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Trilaciclib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for trilaciclib does not recommend regular monitoring of liver tests, but if serum aminotransferase levels above 5 times the ULN are identified, therapy should be held until levels fall into the normal or near normal range, at which point it can be started at the same or a reduced dose as clinically indicated and with close continued monitoring. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the antineoplastic small molecule enzyme and receptor inhibitors, but there is no information on shared adverse event sensitivity of trilaciclib with other antineoplastic protein kinase inhibitors.</p>
