          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Ivosidenib is an orally available small molecule inhibitor of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 that is used as an antineoplastic agent in the treatment of adults of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Ivosidenib is associated with a moderate rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and is suspected to be the cause of rare instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Ivosidenib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ivosidenib (eye" voe sid' i nib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1), an enzyme rearranged and mutated in some forms of leukemia and lymphoma. Isocitrate dehydrogenase is an oxidative decarboxylase which is important in maintaining normal progenitor and stem cell differentiation. Mutation in IDH1 can lead to accumulation of a toxic intermediate (2-hydroxyglutarate; 2-HG) that blocks normal cell differentiation and promotes cancer cell growth. IDH1 mutations are found in 7% to 14% of patients with AML. In cell culture, ivosidenib has been found to decrease 2-HG levels and restore normal cell differentiation in cancer cells with IDH1 mutations. Clinical trials of ivosidenib have demonstrated beneficial objective response rates in adult patients with AML and susceptible IDH1 mutations. Ivosidenib received accelerated approval for use refractory or relapsed AML with mutated IDH1 in the United States in 2018. A specific small molecule inhibitor of IDH2, enasidenib, was approved as therapy of AML with mutations in IDH2 in 2017. These two IDH inhibitors appear to have similar efficacy against their respective mutated enzyme as well as similar adverse effects. The indications for ivosidenib were subsequently expanded to include relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndromes and advanced or metastatic, previously treated, cholangiocarcinoma with susceptible IDH1 mutations or rearrangements. Ivosidenib is available in tablets of 250 mg under the brand name Tibsovo. The dose is 500 mg once daily, continued until progressive disease or intolerable toxicity occurs. Side effects are common and can include fatigue, arthralgia, fever, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspnea, cough, peripheral edema, mucositis and rash. Uncommon, but potentially severe side effects include differentiation syndrome, QTc prolongation, Guillain Barre&#x02019; syndrome, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>

        <sec id="Ivosidenib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>Elevations in serum aminotransferase levels are common during ivosidenib therapy occurring in 15% to 20% of patients but rising above 5 times the upper limit of the normal range in only 1% to 2%. Ivosidenib has had limited clinical use but has not been linked to instances of acute liver injury with symptoms or jaundice. Because of the limited clinical experience with the use of IDH inhibitors, their potential for causing liver injury is not well defined.</p>
          <p>In prelicensure studies, ivosidenib therapy was associated with "differentiation syndrome" in 5% to 20% of patients, which was sometimes severe and life-threatening. Differentiation syndrome is marked by rapid proliferation of myeloid cells and symptoms of respiratory distress, accompanied by hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions. Other manifestations include renal impairment, fever, lymphadenopathy, bone pain, peripheral edema and weight gain. Liver dysfunction can also occur but is generally overshadowed by the more severe systemic manifestations. The onset of differentiation syndrome is generally within 2 to 8 weeks of starting therapy and the course can be severe. Management includes stopping ivosidenib and use of corticosteroids and hydroxyurea in more severe cases. Patients can be restarted on ivosidenib once the syndrome resolves.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>

        <sec id="Ivosidenib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The possible cause of the liver injury due to ivosidenib is not known. Ivosidenib is metabolized in the liver largely by the cytochrome P450 system (largely CYP 3A4) and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with inhibitors or inducers of the microsomal enzyme system. Some serum aminotransferase elevations during ivosidenib therapy may be due to the release of proinflammatory cytokines as a part of the differentiation syndrome.</p>

        <sec id="Ivosidenib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Ivosidenib therapy has been associated with transient serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy but has not been linked to instances of acute liver injury with jaundice or symptoms. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) should lead to temporary discontinuation, which should be permanent if laboratory values do not improve significantly or resolve within a few weeks or if symptoms or jaundice arise.</p>
