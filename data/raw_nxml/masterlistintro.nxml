        <p>The <bold>Master List of LiverTox Drugs</bold> is a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that lists all drugs or agents that are in LiverTox [or are meant to be added in the future] with supporting metadata. Excel provides the ability to manipulate the data such as sorting by type of agent, year of approval or classification, and making counts and calculations that are automatic. For example, the user can sort all drugs by likelihood score or list all antineoplastic (anticancer) drugs. This file and its content are not copyrighted and can be used in data analyses, publications or presentations. Attribution of its use is not required but is always appreciated. The Master List is updated yearly. Approximately 50 new agents are added each year and between 50 and 150 are updated.</p>
