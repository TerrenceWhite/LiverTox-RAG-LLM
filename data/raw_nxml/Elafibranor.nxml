          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Elafibranor is an orally available peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist that is used in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid to treat primary biliary cholangitis. Elafibranor therapy is associated with rare instances of worsening of liver enzymes during therapy but has not been convincingly linked to episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Elafibranor.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Elafibranor (el&#x02019; a fib&#x02019; ran or) is an agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) alpha (&#x003b1;), delta (&#x003b4;), and gamma (&#x003b3;), intracellular receptors with major effects on bile acid synthesis and transport as well as lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis. Studies of other PPAR agonists such as pioglitazone and fenofibrate have suggested at least partial improvement in disease activity with their use in several liver diseases. Furthermore, the PPAR&#x003b1; agonist bezafibrate has been shown to improve liver tests and histology in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC, previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis) and is approved for use in Europe and Japan. Elafibranor has been shown to improve serum enzymes in several diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and primary biliary cholangitis. In a large, placebo controlled trial in PBC, elafibranor therapy was associated with significant improvements in serum alkaline phosphatase levels in 51% of patients compared to only 4% of placebo recipients. Treatment did not improve symptoms, and liver biopsies were not done for assessment of histological changes. Based upon its effects on serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels, elafibranor was granted accelerated approval in 2024 for treatment of adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to or intolerance of ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol). It is typically given in combination with ursodiol but can be given as monotherapy in patients who are intolerant to ursodiol. Elafibranor has not been shown to prolong survival or prevent progression to cirrhosis in patients with PBC, and its continued approval is contingent on further demonstration of its clinical benefit. Elafibranor is available as tablets of 80 mg under the brand name Iqirvo. The recommended dose is 80 mg once daily. Elafibranor is not recommended for patients with advanced or decompensated cirrhosis, or complete biliary obstruction. Common adverse events include weight gain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, arthralgia, constipation, muscle injury, gastroesophageal reflux, dry mouth, weight loss, and rash. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, bone fractures, hypersensitivity reactions, and embryo-fetal toxicity. The risk of myalgia and rhabdomyolysis may be increased by concurrent therapy with statins, and assessment for muscle symptoms and serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels is recommended before and during therapy. Elafibranor may cause fetal harm if taken during pregnancy. Women of child-bearing potential should be tested for pregnancy before starting elafibranor and practice an effective means of birth control during therapy.</p>

        <sec id="Elafibranor.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In preregistration clinical trials, elafibranor was found to decrease both serum aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase elevations in a high proportion of patients with PBC. In preliminary dose-finding studies in healthy volunteers, elevations of ALT and AST levels above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were found to be dose related and occurred in one-third of subjects exposed to doses above 120 mg daily. In contrast, in clinical trials of elafibranor in doses of 80 mg daily in patients with NASH and PBC, ALT elevations above 5 times ULN occurred in only 1% to 2% of patients, typically arising within the first few months of therapy and resolving spontaneously without drug interruption and without jaundice or symptoms. Careful assessment of cases with ALT elevations concluded that 3 were possibly due to drug induced injury, 2 among 138 patients with PBC and 1 among 1433 patients with NASH. Among patients with myalgia and CPK elevations during elafibranor therapy, one patient with preexisting cirrhosis who was also taking a statin, developed jaundice [5.5 mg/dL] with elevations in ALT [300 U/L] and AST [828 U/L] concurrent with rhabdomyolysis [CPK 12,647 U/L] and subsequently suffered hepatic decompensation. The incidence of gallstones and cholecystitis also may be increased with elafibranor therapy. Rare instances of drug induced liver injury are known to occur with other PPAR&#x003b1; (fenofibrate, bezafibrate) and PPAR&#x003b3; (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone) agonists.</p>

        <sec id="Elafibranor.Mechanism_of_Liver_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Liver Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which elafibranor might cause liver injury is unclear, but clinically apparent liver injury from other fibrates is likely immune mediated. Elafibranor is metabolized in the liver by multiple CYP isoenzymes and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions.</p>

          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for elafibranor has a warning about drug induced liver injury and recommends assessing symptoms, signs, and laboratory features of liver disease before starting therapy and monitoring thereafter, with interruption if liver tests worsen or signs and symptoms of acute liver injury arise. If liver tests improve upon stopping but recur with restarting elafibranor, therapy should be permanently discontinued. There is little or no information on cross sensitivity to liver injury or adverse events between elafibranor and other therapies for PBC such as ursodiol, obeticholic acid, and other fibrates.</p>
