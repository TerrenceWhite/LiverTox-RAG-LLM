          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Ponesimod is an orally available immunomodulatory drug used to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Ponesimod is associated with transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy but has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice, although experience with its use has been limited.</p>

        <sec id="Ponesimod.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ponesimod (poe nes&#x02019; i mod) is an immunomodulatory agent used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis that is believed to act by modulating sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors. Ponesimod is an analogue of sphingosine and related in structure to fingolimod, the first S1P receptor modulator approved for use in multiple sclerosis. While fingolimod demonstrates nonspecific S1P receptor binding (subtypes 1, 3, 4 and 5), ponesimod has a more limited specificity and primarily blocks S1P receptor-1 activity. The S1P receptor modulators, once phosphorylated intracellularly, render T and B cells insensitive to signals necessary for egress from lymphoid tissue. In animal models of multiple sclerosis, ponesimod resulted in reduced recirculation of autoaggressive lymphocytes to the central nervous system. Subsequently, in several randomized controlled trials, ponesimod was shown to reduce relapse rates and improve neuro-radiologic outcomes in adult patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Ponesimod was approved for use in the United States in 2021 as therapy of relapsing multiple sclerosis in adults. It is available in tablets of 2 to 10 mg for dose initiation and 20 mg for maintenance therapy under the brand name Ponvory. As with other S1P receptor modulators, a period of dose escalation (14 days) is recommended for initiation of therapy with ponesimod. Ponesimod has also been shown to have beneficial effects in plaque psoriasis, but has yet to be approved for that indication. Common side effects of ponesimod (as with most S1P receptor modulators) are lymphopenia, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, cough, rhinorrhea, peripheral edema and back and abdominal pain. Rare, but potentially severe adverse events include severe viral, bacterial or fungal infections, atrial arrhythmias and bradycardia, macular edema, decrease in pulmonary function, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), and embryonal-fetal toxicity. Patients on long term ponesimod should be monitored for infectious complications and for cardiac, pulmonary and ophthalmologic status.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ponesimod.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In preregistration trials of ponesimod, serum ALT elevations were common (in up to 23% of recipients) but were typically mild and asymptomatic, returning to baseline values even with continuation of therapy or within a few months of stopping. In one prospective, carefully monitored trial, serum aminotransferase elevations above 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) were reported in 17% of ponesimod recipients and above 5 times ULN in 4.6%. In these prelicensure clinical trials, there were no cases of acute hepatitis or clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice, but elevations in liver tests led to early discontinuation in at least 2% of subjects. While ponesimod is associated with lymphopenia and long-term therapy is associated with risk for reactivation of herpes simplex and zoster infections, it has not been linked to cases of reactivation of hepatitis B although one such case has been reported with fingolimod. Thus, mild-to-moderate and transient serum enzyme elevations during therapy are common, but clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice due to ponesimod has not been reported, although the clinical experience with its use has been limited.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (suspected but unproven cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ponesimod.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which ponesimod might cause liver injury is not known. It is extensively metabolized by liver via multiple enzymes in the cytochrome P450 system, predominantly CYP 3A4, and drug-drug interactions with agents that induce or inhibit these enzymes are likely to occur. Serum enzyme elevations have been frequent with all of the oral S1P receptor modulators, particularly with fingolimod.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ponesimod.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>While chronic therapy with ponesimod can be associated with mild-to-moderate serum aminotransferase elevations, it has not been linked to any cases of clinically apparent liver injury. Because of the frequency of enzyme elevations detected during therapy, the product label for ponesimod recommends obtaining baseline liver tests before initiation of treatment. However, no specific recommendations for monitoring liver tests during treatment have been made. Any ALT or AST elevation associated with symptoms or jaundice should lead to prompt discontinuation of ponesimod. Patients with persistent elevations above 3 times ULN should be assessed for other causes of liver injury and discontinue ponesimod if not other cause is found. There is no known cross sensitivity of the hepatic injury from ponesimod with other agents used to treat multiple sclerosis. Because of the similarity in chemical structure and mechanism of action, there may be cross sensitivity to side effects with fingolimod, siponimod and ozanimod.</p>
