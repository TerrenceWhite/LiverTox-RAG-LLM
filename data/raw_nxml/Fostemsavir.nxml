          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Fostemsavir is a unique antiretroviral agent that binds to an envelope antigen of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) inhibiting its attachment to cell surface receptors of CD4+ lymphocytes. It is used to treat patients with multidrug resistant infection and inadequate viral suppression despite optimized background therapy. Fostemsavir has been linked to a low rate of serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy but has not been linked convincingly to episodes of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Fostemsavir.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Fostemsavir (fos tem&#x02019; sa vir) is a unique antiretroviral drug that binds the gp120 subunit of the HIV envelope protein that mediates viral attachment to cell surface receptors on CD4+ lymphocytes, an initial and necessary step in HIV replication. Fostemsavir has both in vitro and in vivo activity against HIV and was developed as an adjunctive therapy for heavily treatment-experienced patients with multidrug antiviral resistance who had failed to achieve adequate viral suppression on a potent antiretroviral regimen. In large, long term, open label studies, the addition of fostemsavir to an optimized background regimen of antiretroviral agents resulted in full viral suppression (less than 50 HIV RNA copies per mL) in 38% to 54% of patients, with accompanying improvements in peripheral CD4 counts. Fostemsavir was approved as therapy of adults with multidrug-resistant HIV infection in the United States in 2020, but only in combination with other antiretroviral agents. Fostemsavir is available in tablets of 600 mg under the brand name Rukobia. The recommended dose is 600 mg twice daily. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, headache, abdominal pain, dyspnea, fatigue, itching, rash, sleep disturbance, and somnolence. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include immune reconstitution syndrome, QTc prolongation, peripheral neuropathy and worsening of chronic coinfection with hepatitis B or C virus.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Fostemsavir.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In registration clinical trials, fostemsavir was associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations in up to 25% of patients, but levels above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) arose in only 4% of subjects. Most ALT elevations were transient, asymptomatic, and did not require dose modification or discontinuation. The more marked ALT elevations were usually attributable to other conditions or complications of HIV infection. No convincing cases of fostemsavir induced liver injury were observed in preregistration trials. Since approval of fostemsavir for use as a part of a multidrug therapy of HIV, there have been no published case reports of clinically apparent liver injury attributed to its use.</p>
          <p>Interestingly, in the large preregistration trial of fostemsavir, elevations in serum aminotransferase levels were particularly noted in patients with coinfection with either hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV). The deaths from liver disease in this trial appeared to be due to worsening of the coinfection during therapy. Clearly, patients with HBV or HCV coinfection should be treated for those viral infections before or concurrent with antiretroviral therapy with fostemsavir.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Fostemsavir.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Fostemsavir is metabolized predominantly by esterase mediated hydrolysis and to a lesser extent by hepatic microsomal enzymes, predominantly CYP 3A4. Strong inducers of CYP 3A4 have the potential of lowering levels of fostemsavir and should be avoided if possible.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Fostemsavir.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Serum enzyme elevations during fostemsavir therapy are generally transient, mild-to-moderate in severity, and often attributable to other causes. Because of the complexity of therapy for multidrug resistant HIV infection, caution should be used in altering the dose or discontinuation of fostemsavir unless the adverse events is clearly due to the gp120 attachment inhibitor.</p>

<italic toggle="yes">(Further analysis of the phase 3 trial of fostemsavir in 371 patients with multidrug resistant HIV infection [Koval 020] demonstrated virologic responses observed at 24 weeks were maintained long term (to week 96] with gradual increase in CD4 lymphocyte counts overall, and that higher response rates and fewer adverse events occurred among patients with higher baseline CD4 counts and lower baseline HIV RNA levels; no mention of hepatic adverse events or ALT levels).</italic>
