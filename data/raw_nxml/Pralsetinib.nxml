          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Pralsetinib is an oral selective inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by RET (rearranged during transfection), a proto-oncogene which is mutated or altered in many cancers such a medullary thyroid cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Serum aminotransferase elevations are common during pralsetinib therapy and can lead to dose modifications or discontinuations, but pralsetinib has not been linked to clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Pralsetinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Pralsetinib (pral seh&#x02019; ti nib) is an orally available, small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the proto-oncogene RET (rearranged during transfection), which is mutated or altered in several cancers including 1% to 2% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), up to 70% of medullary thyroid cancers and approximately 10% of other thyroid cancers. Pralsetinib was found to be a potent inhibitor of cell growth and proliferation in tumor cell lines and experimental tumor models with RET mutations or RET gene fusion. In open label trials of pralsetinib in patients with advanced or metastatic medullary thyroid cancer and NSCLC harboring alterations in RET, objective response rates ranged from 56% to 85%. Pralsetinib was given accelerated approval for use in the United States in 2020 and subsequently received full approval. It has shown efficacy in several other solid tumors that harbor RET gene-alterations. Pralsetinib is available in capsules of 100 mg under the brand name Gavreto. The recommended dose is 400 mg once daily in adults and children 12 years of age or above. Side effects are common and can include dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, systemic arterial hypertension, myalgia, fever, cough, edema, anemia, neutropenia, elevations in serum creatinine, uric acid, and aminotransferase levels. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include interstitial pneumonitis, severe hypertension, hemorrhagic events, tumor lysis syndrome, impaired wound healing, and embryo-fetal toxicity. In preregistration trials, adverse events led to dose interruptions in 60%, dose reductions in 36%, and permanent discontinuations in 15% of pralsetinib treated patients. Deaths from treatment related adverse events were rare [&#x0003c;1%] and usually due to sepsis or pneumonitis.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pralsetinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure clinical trials of pralsetinib in patients with RET mutations or RET fusion gene-positive solid tumors, liver test abnormalities were frequent although usually mild. Some degree of ALT elevation arose in 41% of pralsetinib treated patients, but were above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in only 2% to 3%. The median time to onset of ALT elevations was 22 days with a range of 7 days to more than a year. In these trials that enrolled approximately 438 patients, serious hepatic adverse events were reported in 2.1% but were mostly transient serum aminotransferase elevations. There were no fatal hepatic events and no instance of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. Pralsetinib was discontinued early due to increased AST or ALT in 0.8% of patients. Thus, in preregistration trials of pralsetinib there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice, but therapy was associated with a high rate of serum ALT elevations and the total clinical experience with its use has been limited. Nevertheless, careful monitoring of liver tests is recommended during pralsetinib therapy.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pralsetinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The cause of the serum aminotransferase elevations during pralsetinib therapy is unknown, but the pattern of abnormalities and the response to dose adjustment suggests some degree of low level, direct hepatotoxicity. Pralsetinib is metabolized in the liver via the cytochrome P450 system, largely CYP 3A4, and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce the CYP enzyme reactivity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Pralsetinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for pralsetinib recommends monitoring for routine liver tests before, at 2-week intervals during the first 3 months of therapy, and monthly thereafter as clinically indicated. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) should lead to dose reduction or temporary cessation of pralsetinib therapy until serum enzymes return to normal or near normal levels. In patients with clinically apparent liver injury and jaundice, restarting therapy should be done with caution. Cross sensitivity to liver injury is uncommon among the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but there is no information or shared adverse event sensitivity of pralsetinib with other RET inhibitors such as selpercatinib or other antineoplastic protein kinase inhibitors.</p>
