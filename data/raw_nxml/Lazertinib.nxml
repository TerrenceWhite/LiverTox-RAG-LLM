          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Lazertinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor that is used in combination with amivantamab to treat adults with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that harbors EGF receptor mutations. The combination of lazertinib and amivantamab is associated with transient elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy but has not been linked to episodes of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>

        <sec id="Lazertinib.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Lazertinib (laz&#x02019; er tin ib) is an orally available, specific inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor that is used in combination with amivantamab in the therapy of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGF receptor mutations. EGF receptors are frequently mutated in lung cancer and can account for drug resistance using conventional EGF receptor inhibitors. Lazertinib has activity against wild type EGF receptors and has potent activity against receptors that harbor exon 19 deletions and exon 21 L858R, which are found in 10% to 15% of patients diagnosed with NSCLC. In a large, controlled trial, lazertinib in combination with amivantamab (a bispecific monoclonal antibody to the EGF receptor and MET) was compared to the current standard EGF receptor kinase inhibitor (osimertinib) for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. The median progression-free survival was superior with the combination (23.7 months) compared to osimertinib (16.6 months). Lazertinib in combination with amivantamab was approved as a first line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring mutations of exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R in 2024. Lazertinib is available in tablets of 80 and 240 mg under the brand name Lazcluze. The recommended dose is 240 mg once daily in combination with amivantamab (brand name Rybrevant) given intravenously once weekly for 4 weeks followed by every 3 weeks until unacceptable intolerance or disease progression arises. Side effects are common with lazertinib and amivantamab combination therapy. Common, mild-to-moderate side effects include rash, nail toxicity, infusion related reactions, fatigue, stomatitis, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, decreased appetite, edema, musculoskeletal pain, paresthesia, pruritus, and abdominal pain. Less frequent but potentially severe adverse events include severe infusion related reactions, interstitial lung disease, venous thromboembolic events, severe skin rash, ocular toxicity and embryo-fetal toxicity. The combination has a boxed warning about thromboembolic events and routine anticoagulation is recommended for the first 4 months of treatment.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lazertinib.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In the prelicensure trial of the combination of lazertinib and amivantamab, liver test abnormalities were frequent, with elevations in ALT of 65%, AST 65%, and GGT 39% but without bilirubin elevations. The enzyme elevations were usually transient, mild-to-moderate in severity and not associated with symptoms or jaundice. ALT elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) arose in 7% of subjects and were self-limited in course and not associated with jaundice. The ALT elevations led to dose interruptions in 6% of patients but not to drug discontinuations. Some of the aminotransferase elevations may have been due to amivantamab rather than lazertinib or even to the anticoagulants that are used during the first 4 months of therapy. There were no deaths or episodes of life threatening liver injury among the 421 patients receiving combination therapy in the preregistration safety cohort. Since approval and more widespread use of lazertinib and amivantamab, there have been no published case reports of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice. Nevertheless, several instances of severe and even fatal liver injury have been linked to use of other EGF kinase inhibitors such as afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E* (unproven but suspected rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lazertinib.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The causes of serum enzyme elevations or liver injury from lazertinib therapy are probably the result of direct toxicity of the multi-kinase receptor inhibition. Lazertinib is metabolized in the liver largely via the CYP 3A4 pathway, and liver injury might also be caused by production of a toxic or immunogenic intermediate of its metabolism. Because it is a substrate for CYP 3A4, lazertinib is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with agents that inhibit or induce this specific hepatic microsomal activity.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Lazertinib.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The product label for lazertinib recommends monitoring of liver tests before initiating therapy and frequently during treatment. Serum aminotransferase elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal (if confirmed) or any elevations accompanied by jaundice or symptoms should lead to at least temporary cessation. There is no evidence to suggest a cross reactivity in risk for adverse events, hypersensitivity, or hepatic injury between lazertinib and other EGF receptor inhibitors such as afatinib, mobocertinib, or osimertinib.</p>
