          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Ublituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody to CD20, a cell surface marker found on B lymphocytes and plasma cells, which is used to treat adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis. Ublituximab has not been linked to liver enzyme elevations during therapy or to instances of clinically apparent liver injury, but like other monoclonal antibodies to CD20, ublituximab can cause reactivation of hepatitis B.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ublituximab.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Ublituximab (ue&#x0201d; bli tux&#x02019; i mab) is a chimeric, glygcoengineered monoclonal IgG1 antibody to the CD20 antigen which is used to treat adults with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). Ublituximab binds to the cell surface marker CD20 on B lymphocytes and causes their depletion resulting in a decrease in spontaneous autoantibody production. This monoclonal antibody has been shown to be effective in reducing disease activity in patients with severe forms of relapsing multiple sclerosis, a disease marked by immune dysregulation and production of pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes. Ublituximab was approved for use in the United States in 2022 and current indications are for treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease. Ublituximab was the third monoclonal antibody to CD20 approve for use in multiple sclerosis, the others being ofatumumab (Arzerra: 2009) and ocrelizumab (Ocrevus: 2017). Ublituximab is available in under the brand name Briumvi in single dose vials of 150 mg in 6 mL (25 mg/mL). The recommended dose regimen is an initial intravenous infusion of 150 mg followed by an infusion of 450 mg 2 weeks later and then 450 mg every 24 weeks. Premedication with methylprednisone and an antihistamine is recommended for the first two infusions and patients should be monitored for hypersensitivity reactions for at least one hour. Thereafter, premedication should be used as needed for patients who had troublesome reactions during the first two infusions. Other adverse effects include infections, reduction in immunoglobulin levels, bronchitis, cough, fatigue, headache, insomnia, nausea, and herpes zoster. Rare but potentially serious side effects include severe hypersensitivity reactions (angioedema or anaphylaxis), severe infections, reactivation of hepatitis B and other viral (herpes simplex and zoster), fungal, and mycobacterial infections, and possibly fetal-embryonal toxicity. Screening for hepatitis B virus infection and immunoglobulins is recommended before starting therapy. The potential of reactivation of tuberculosis is not clear. Patients receiving ublituximab should receive all appropriate vaccines (inactivated and live) well before starting therapy. Because of the possibility of fetal injury, women of child-bearing potential should be screened for pregnancy before and practice an effective means of birth control during and for six months after ublituximab therapy.</p>

        <sec id="Ublituximab.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In preregistration controlled trials, elevations in serum aminotransferase levels above 3 times the ULN arose in 3.5% of patients receiving ublituximab vs 4.2% of those on teriflunomide, the comparative agent. Two patients receiving ublituximab developed marked ALT and AST elevations accompanied by jaundice, but both were shown to be due to an unrelated cause, one due to acute hepatitis C and the other due to chronic hepatitis B (possibly caused by reactivation). Since its approval and more widescale use, there have been no case reports of liver injury with jaundice linked to ublituximab therapy. Because ublituximab is immunosuppressive, it may cause reactivation of hepatitis B in susceptible persons. Reactivation of hepatitis B can be severe and is sometimes fatal, as has occurred with other monoclonal antibodies directed against CD20 such ofatumumab, ocrelizumab, and rituximab.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: D (possible cause of clinically apparent liver injury as a result of reactivation of hepatitis B).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ublituximab.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>There is little evidence that ublituximab is a cause of idiosyncratic liver injury and mechanisms by which it might occur is not clear but might result from immune modulation. Ublituximab suppresses B cell reactivity and is capable of inducing reactivation of hepatitis B in susceptible patients.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Ublituximab.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase elevations that have been reported during ublituximab therapy were generally transient, mild and asymptomatic and did not require dose modification or delay in therapy. Elevations above 5 times the upper limit of normal should lead to a careful search for other causes of liver injury and more careful monitoring. Because ublituximab is given every 24 weeks, suspension of infusions while waiting for further diagnostic results or for levels returning to normal or near normal levels is usually unnecessary. There is no evidence of cross sensitivity to hepatic reactions among the various monoclonal antibodies. Although the product label for ublituximab does not recommend baseline screening or regular monitoring of liver tests, it is reasonable to include a metabolic panel with routine liver tests as well as a complete blood count before starting therapy and at the 24-week intervals when the agent is administered. Because ublituximab is immunosuppressive, it may cause reactivation of hepatitis B in susceptible persons. Patients should be screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologic markers before starting therapy. Ublituximab is contraindicated in patients with active hepatitis B, and patients with anti-HBc without HBsAg in serum should be considered for prophylaxis against reactivation or monitored closely for early evidence of an appearance of HBV DNA in serum, which should prompt antiviral therapy with an agent with potent activity against HBV.</p>
