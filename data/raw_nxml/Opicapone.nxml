          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Opicapone is a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor that is used as adjunctive therapy to levodopa/carbidopa in patients with Parkinson disease experiencing difficulty with &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; episodes when motor symptoms breakthrough on treatment. Opicapone has been associated with a minimal rate of serum enzyme elevations during therapy and has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent liver injury with jaundice.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Opicapone.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Opicapone (oh pik&#x02019; a pone) is a catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor that blocks the peripheral metabolism of levodopa and prolongs its serum half-life and effectiveness in providing dopamine to the brain. Levodopa/carbidopa is the mainstay of therapy of Parkinson disease, increasing brain dopamine levels and typically alleviating the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease for 5 to 6 hours. After the first 2 to 5 years of therapy, however, the duration of benefit becomes shorter (wearing off effect), and patients develop fluctuations between mobility and immobility (on-off effect). Opicapone, by slowing the metabolism of levodopa increases its duration of action. In several prospective randomized, placebo controlled trials, opicapone was found to decrease the duration of wake &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time episodes and increase the amount of &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; time. Opicapone was approved for use as adjunctive therapy to levodopa and carbidopa for adults with Parkinson disease who experienced off episodes in 2020. Opicapone is currently available in capsules of 25 and 50 mg under the brand name Ongentys. The recommended dose is 50 mg once daily. While opicapone may improve control of symptoms, there is no evidence that it slows the progression of Parkinson disease. Common side effects include dyskinesia, dizziness, constipation, nausea, daytime sleepiness, and insomnia. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include hallucinations, psychotic and compulsive behaviors, hypersexuality, and severe dyskinesia. Abrupt discontinuation of opicapone can be followed by a withdrawal symptoms of hyperpyrexia and confusion.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Opicapone.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In prelicensure controlled trials, serum ALT elevations occurred uncommonly in opicapone-treated subjects and in rates similar to that of placebo controls. In studies of more than 1000 patients treated with opicapone there were no instances of serious hepatic events and no relevant changes in serum enzymes. After its approval and more widespread use, there have been no reports clinically apparent liver injury attributable to opicapone. There has, however, been limited clinical experience with its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Opicapone.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>Opicapone was the third COMT inhibitor approved as adjuvant therapy with levodopa in patients with Parkinson disease who were experiencing motor complications (&#x0201c;off&#x0201d; episodes). The initial COMT inhibitor approved for use was tolcapone, which was associated with a high rate of marked serum aminotransferase elevations during therapy and subsequently with several reports of clinically apparent liver injury. For that reason, tolcapone is subjected to a strict monitoring program in which regular testing of serum aminotransferase levels is strongly advised. Because opicapone has not been found to cause aminotransferase elevations, regular monitoring is not required or even recommended. The reasons for the relative safety of opicapone in comparison to tolcapone are unclear. Opicapone is metabolized by sulfonylation and glucuronidation rather than by the cytochrome P450 microsomal enzymes (CYP).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Opicapone.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>Opicapone has been not been linked to serum enzyme elevations during therapy. Discontinuation for serum enzyme elevations is rarely necessary, but should be done if the elevations are accompanied by symptoms or jaundice or for ALT elevations of more than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). There is no information on cross sensitivity to liver injury between opicapone and other agents used in the therapy of Parkinson disease.</p>
