          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Viloxazine is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is used in the therapy of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children. Viloxazine has been associated with uncommon and mild serum enzyme elevations during therapy but not with occurrence of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>

        <sec id="Viloxazine.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Viloxazine (vye lox&#x0201d; a zeen) is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that is used to treat pediatric attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD is marked by variable degrees of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity that is inconsistent with developmental levels and that impairs daily life. It is the most common neurodevelopment disorder of children and persists into adulthood in at least 20% of cases. ADHD has major effects on learning and academic achievement as well as social interactions and occupational success. ADHD is reported to affect 9% of children in the United States, and its incidence appears to be increasing. Pharmacologic therapies can alleviate many of the symptoms of ADHD, but are not always well tolerated. Currently approved drugs for ADHD are separated into those that are neurostimulatory (amphetamines, methylphenidate) versus nonstimulatory (such as atomoxetine [an SNRI], viloxazine, guanfacine and clonidine). While viloxazine is considered a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, it also has selective serotonergic activity, being a serotonin (5-HT)<sub>2B</sub> receptor agonist and 5-HT<sub>3C</sub> receptor antagonist, features that may be important in its beneficial effects. In several randomized placebo-controlled, short term trials in children (ages 6 to 11 years) and adolescents (ages 12 to 17 years), viloxazine was found to improve symptoms of ADHD including inattention and impulsivity/hyperactivity. Viloxazine was approved in the United States as therapy for ADHD in children in 2021. It is available in extended-release capsules of 100, 150 and 200 mg under the brand name Qelbree. For children ages 6 to 11 years, the recommended initial dose is 100 mg once daily which can be increased at weekly intervals to a maximum of 400 mg daily. For children ages 12 to 17 years, the initial dose should be 200 mg once daily, which can be increased to a maximum of 400 mg daily. Side effects can include somnolence, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, irritability, headache and weight loss. Viloxazine can also increase blood pressure and pulse which should be monitored during therapy. Uncommon but potentially severe adverse events include severe somnolence, new onset or recurrence of mania, suicidal ideation and behavior, and embryo-fetal toxicity.</p>

        <sec id="Viloxazine.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In four placebo-controlled trials of viloxazine in children with ADHD, minor serum aminotransferase elevations occurred in 5% to 10% of recipients but were more than 2 times the upper limit of normal in less than 1%. In the preregistration trials, there were no instances of clinically apparent liver injury or serum aminotransferase elevations with jaundice attributable to viloxazine. Since its approval as therapy for depression in Europe more than 30 years ago and as therapy of ADHD in the United States in 2021, there have been no publications describing clinically apparent liver injury due to viloxazine. Furthermore, summaries of the efficacy and safety of viloxazine do not mention hepatic adverse events. Nevertheless, long term clinical experience with viloxazine in children is limited, and other SNRIs (such as atomoxetine) have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of acute liver injury with jaundice).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Viloxazine.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which viloxazine might cause liver injury is not known but may be due to a toxic or immunogenic intermediate product of its metabolism. Viloxazine is metabolized in the liver largely via the cytochrome P450 system. It is a strong inhibitor CYP 1A2 and weak inducer of CYP 2D6 and 3A4 and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions, particularly with caffeine and theophylline which should be avoided. Viloxazine does not appear to have adverse interactions with methylphenidate.</p>

<italic toggle="yes">(Among 313 children, ages 6 to 11 years, with ADHD treated with viloxazine [200 or 400 mg] or placebo once daily for 8 weeks, improvements in ADHD rating scores were greater with viloxazine than placebo [-17.6 and -17.5 vs -11.7] while common adverse events were somnolence [14% vs 1%], decreased appetite [8% vs 0], fatigue [7% vs 5%], headache [7% vs 1%] and abdominal pain [5% vs 2%], which sometimes led to discontinuation, while laboratory test results were largely mild and transient, one child receiving 400 mg of viloxazine had an elevated ALT value [86 U/L]).</italic>
