          <title>Introduction</title>
          <p>Crinecerfont is small molecule inhibitor of the corticotropin releasing factor receptor which is used to treat patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Crinecerfont is has not been associated with significant elevations in serum aminotransferase levels during therapy or with instances of clinically apparent liver injury.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Crinecerfont.Background">
          <title>Background</title>
          <p>Crinecerfont (kri&#x0201d; ne ser&#x02019; font) is a small molecule inhibitor of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor that blocks the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and consequent release of adrenal hormones including glucocorticoids (cortisol), mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), and androgen and estrogen precursor molecules such as androstenedione. Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to a deficiency in 21-hydroxylase, which results in cortisol deficiency that subsequently leads to increased levels of ACTH, excessive stimulation of the adrenals, and overproduction of androgens. While the cortisol deficiency and risk of adrenal crises can be managed with glucocorticoids, the overproduction of androgen leads to growth acceleration, atypical genitalia, hirsutism and acne (in females), precocious puberty, early growth-plate fusion, short stature, and infertility. High doses of glucocorticoids can decrease androgen production to some extent but come with dose limiting side effects. Crinecerfont allows for lower daily glucocorticoid therapy by decreasing ACTH production, adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen overproduction. In placebo-controlled trials in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, crinecerfont was found to lower hormone levels (corticotropin, androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone) and decrease corticosteroid dose requirements often to physiologic doses. Crinecerfont was approved in the United States in 2024 for use in children and adults with congenital adrenal hyperplasia and is available in capsules of 25, 50, and 100 mg and as an oral solution of 50 mg/mL under the brand name Crenessity. The recommended dose in adults is 100 mg twice daily with meals. In children, the dose is weight-based twice daily with meals. Common side effects may include fatigue, headaches, dizziness, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, back pain, arthralgia, and myalgia. Less common but potentially severe adverse events include hypersensitivity reactions such as rash and angioedema, suicidal ideation and behaviors, and adrenal insufficiency because of inadequate glucocorticoid replacement dosage. Glucocorticoids must be continued during crinecerfont therapy at replacement doses. Increase in dose may be needed during periods of stress or infections.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Crinecerfont.Hepatotoxicity">
          <title>Hepatotoxicity</title>
          <p>In registration clinical trials, liver test abnormalities were infrequent during crinecerfont therapy and no more common than with placebo. There were no instances of ALT or AST elevations above 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) and no cases of liver injury with jaundice or symptoms. Clinical experience with crinecerfont therapy has been limited, but there have no published reports of clinical apparent liver injury with its use.</p>
          <p>Likelihood score: E (unlikely cause of clinically apparent liver injury).</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Crinecerfont.Mechanism_of_Injury">
          <title>Mechanism of Injury</title>
          <p>The mechanism by which crinecerfont might cause serum aminotransferase elevation is not known. It is a small molecule and is metabolized in the liver, largely via CYP 3A4. Crinecerfont is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with moderate or strong CYP 3A4 inducers requiring dose increases, and they should be avoided if possible.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec id="Crinecerfont.Outcome_and_Management">
          <title>Outcome and Management</title>
          <p>The serum aminotransferase elevations that occurred on crinecerfont therapy were infrequent and not considered due to the drug therapy. Elevations of ALT or AST found during therapy should lead to search for the cause of the abnormalities. Any aminotransferase elevations with symptoms or jaundice should lead to at least temporary discontinuation until the injury has resolved or the alternative cause identified.</p>
